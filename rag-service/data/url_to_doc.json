India , officially the Republic of India , [ j ] [ 20 ] is a country in South Asia .  It is the seventh-largest country by area ; the most populous country since 2023; [ 21 ] and, since its independence in 1947, the world's most populous democracy. [ 22 ] [ 23 ] [ 24 ] Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast, it shares land borders with Pakistan to the west; [ k ] China , Nepal , and Bhutan to the north; and Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east. In the Indian Ocean , India is near Sri Lanka and the Maldives ; its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Myanmar, Thailand , and Indonesia . Modern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no later than 55,000 years ago. [ 26 ] [ 27 ] [ 28 ] Their long occupation, predominantly in isolation as hunter-gatherers, has made the region highly diverse. [ 29 ] Settled life emerged on the subcontinent in the western margins of the Indus river basin 9,000 years ago, evolving gradually into the Indus Valley Civilisation of the third millennium BCE. [ 30 ] By 1200 BCE , an archaic form of Sanskrit , an Indo-European language , had diffused into India from the northwest. [ 31 ] [ 32 ] Its hymns recorded the early dawnings of Hinduism in India. [ 33 ] India's pre-existing Dravidian languages were supplanted in the northern regions. [ 34 ] By 400 BCE , caste had emerged within Hinduism, [ 35 ] and Buddhism and Jainism had arisen, proclaiming social orders unlinked to heredity. [ 36 ] Early political consolidations gave rise to the loose-knit Maurya and Gupta Empires . [ 37 ] Widespread creativity suffused this era, [ 38 ] but the status of women declined, [ 39 ] and untouchability became an organised belief. [ l ] [ 40 ] In South India , the Middle kingdoms exported Dravidian language scripts and religious cultures to the kingdoms of Southeast Asia . [ 41 ] In the early medieval era, Christianity , Islam , Judaism , and Zoroastrianism became established on India's southern and western coasts. [ 42 ] Muslim armies from Central Asia intermittently overran India's northern plains in the second millennium. [ 43 ] The resulting Delhi Sultanate drew northern India into the cosmopolitan networks of medieval Islam . [ 44 ] In south India, the Vijayanagara Empire created a long-lasting composite Hindu culture. [ 45 ] In the Punjab , Sikhism emerged, rejecting institutionalised religion. [ 46 ] The Mughal Empire ushered in two centuries of economic expansion and relative peace, [ 47 ] leaving a rich architectural legacy . [ 48 ] [ 49 ] Gradually expanding rule of the British East India Company turned India into a colonial economy but consolidated its sovereignty . [ 50 ] British Crown rule began in 1858. The rights promised to Indians were granted slowly, [ 51 ] [ 52 ] but technological changes were introduced, and modern ideas of education and the public life took root. [ 53 ] A nationalist movement emerged in India, the first in the non-European British Empire and an influence on other nationalist movements. [ 54 ] [ 55 ] Noted for nonviolent resistance after 1920, [ 56 ] it became the primary factor in ending British rule. [ 57 ] In 1947, the British Indian Empire was partitioned into two independent dominions , [ 58 ] [ 59 ] [ 60 ] [ 61 ] a Hindu-majority dominion of India and a Muslim-majority dominion of Pakistan . A large-scale loss of life and an unprecedented migration accompanied the partition. [ 62 ] India has been a federal republic since 1950, governed through a democratic parliamentary system . It is a pluralistic , multilingual and multi-ethnic society . India's population grew from 361 million in 1951 to over 1.4 billion in 2023. [ 63 ] During this time, its nominal per capita income increased from US$64 annually to US$2,601, and its literacy rate from 16.6% to 74%. A comparatively destitute country in 1951, [ 64 ] India has become a fast-growing major economy and a hub for information technology services , with an expanding middle class. [ 65 ] Indian movies and music increasingly influence global culture. [ 66 ] India has reduced its poverty rate , though at the cost of increasing economic inequality. [ 67 ] It is a nuclear-weapon state that ranks high in military expenditure . It has disputes over Kashmir with its neighbours, Pakistan and China, unresolved since the mid-20th century. [ 68 ] Among the socio-economic challenges India faces are gender inequality , child malnutrition , [ 69 ] and rising levels of air pollution . [ 70 ] India's land is megadiverse with four biodiversity hotspots . [ 71 ] India's wildlife , which has traditionally been viewed with tolerance in its culture , [ 72 ] is supported in protected habitats . Etymology Main article: Names for India According to the Oxford English Dictionary (2009), the name \"India\" is derived from the Classical Latin India , a reference to South Asia and an uncertain region to its east. In turn \"India\" derived successively from Hellenistic Greek India ( Ἰνδία ), Ancient Greek Indos ( Ἰνδός ), Old Persian Hindush (an eastern province of the Achaemenid Empire ), and ultimately its cognate , the Sanskrit Sindhu , or 'river'—specifically the Indus River , and by extension its well-settled southern basin. [ 73 ] [ 74 ] The Ancient Greeks referred to the Indians as Indoi , 'the people of the Indus'. [ 75 ] The term Bharat ( Bhārat ; pronounced [ˈbʱaːɾət] ⓘ ), mentioned in both Indian epic poetry and the Constitution of India , [ 76 ] [ 77 ] is used in its variations by many Indian languages . A modern rendering of the historical name Bharatavarsha , which applied originally to North India , [ 78 ] [ 79 ] Bharat gained increased currency from the mid-19th century as a native name for India. [ 76 ] [ 80 ] Hindustan ( [ɦɪndʊˈstaːn] ⓘ ) is a Middle Persian name for India that became popular by the 13th century, [ 81 ] and was used widely since the era of the Mughal Empire . The meaning of Hindustan has varied, referring to a region encompassing the northern Indian subcontinent (present-day northern India and Pakistan ) or to India in its near entirety. [ 76 ] [ 80 ] [ 82 ] History Main article: History of India Ancient India Manuscript illustration, c. 1650 , of the Sanskrit epic Ramayana , composed in story-telling fashion c. 400 BCE – c. 300 CE [ 83 ] 55,000 years ago, the first modern humans, or Homo sapiens , arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa. [ 26 ] [ 27 ] [ 28 ] The earliest known modern human remains in South Asia date to about 30,000 years ago. [ 26 ] After 6500 BCE , evidence for domestication of food crops and animals, construction of permanent structures, and storage of agricultural surplus appeared in Mehrgarh and other sites in Balochistan, Pakistan . [ 84 ] These gradually developed into the Indus Valley Civilisation , [ 85 ] [ 84 ] the first urban culture in South Asia, [ 86 ] which flourished during 2500–1900 BCE in Pakistan and western India. [ 87 ] Centred around cities such as Mohenjo-daro , Harappa , Dholavira , and Kalibangan , and relying on varied forms of subsistence, the civilisation engaged robustly in crafts production and wide-ranging trade. [ 86 ] During the period 2000–500 BCE , many regions of the subcontinent transitioned from the Chalcolithic cultures to the Iron Age ones. [ 88 ] The Vedas , the oldest scriptures associated with Hinduism , [ 89 ] were composed during this period, [ 90 ] and historians have analysed these to posit a Vedic culture in the Punjab region and the upper Gangetic Plain . [ 88 ] Most historians also consider this period to have encompassed several waves of Indo-Aryan migration into the subcontinent from the north-west. [ 89 ] The caste system , which created a hierarchy of priests, warriors, and free peasants, but which excluded indigenous peoples by labelling their occupations impure, arose during this period. [ 91 ] On the Deccan Plateau , archaeological evidence from this period suggests the existence of a chiefdom stage of political organisation. [ 88 ] In South India , a progression to sedentary life is indicated by the large number of megalithic monuments dating from this period, [ 92 ] as well as by nearby traces of agriculture , irrigation tanks , and craft traditions. [ 92 ] Cave 26 of the rock-cut Ajanta Caves In the late Vedic period, around the 6th century BCE, the small states and chiefdoms of the Ganges Plain and the north-western regions had consolidated into 16 major oligarchies and monarchies that were known as the mahajanapadas . [ 93 ] [ 94 ] The emerging urbanisation gave rise to non-Vedic religious movements, two of which became independent religions. Jainism came into prominence during the life of its exemplar, Mahavira . [ 95 ] Buddhism , based on the teachings of Gautama Buddha , attracted followers from all social classes excepting the middle class; chronicling the life of the Buddha was central to the beginnings of recorded history in India. [ 96 ] [ 97 ] [ 98 ] In an age of increasing urban wealth, both religions held up renunciation as an ideal, [ 99 ] and both established long-lasting monastic traditions. Politically, by the 3rd century BCE, the kingdom of Magadha had annexed or reduced other states to emerge as the Maurya Empire . [ 100 ] The empire was once thought to have controlled most of the subcontinent except the far south, but its core regions are now thought to have been separated by large autonomous areas. [ 101 ] [ 102 ] The Mauryan kings are known as much for their empire-building and determined management of public life as for Ashoka 's renunciation of militarism and far-flung advocacy of the Buddhist dhamma . [ 103 ] [ 104 ] The Sangam literature of the Tamil language reveals that, between 200 BCE and 200 CE , the southern peninsula was ruled by the Cheras , the Cholas , and the Pandyas , dynasties that traded extensively with the Roman Empire and with West and Southeast Asia . [ 105 ] [ 106 ] In North India, Hinduism asserted patriarchal control within the family, leading to increased subordination of women. [ 107 ] [ 100 ] By the 4th and 5th centuries, the Gupta Empire had created a complex system of administration and taxation in the greater Ganges Plain; this system became a model for later Indian kingdoms. [ 108 ] [ 109 ] Under the Guptas, a renewed Hinduism based on devotion, rather than the management of ritual, began to assert itself. [ 110 ] This renewal was reflected in a flowering of sculpture and architecture , which found patrons among an urban elite. [ 109 ] Classical Sanskrit literature flowered as well, and Indian science , astronomy , medicine , and mathematics made significant advances. [ 109 ] Medieval India Main article: Medieval India Brihadeshwara temple , Thanjavur , completed in 1010 CE The Qutub Minar , 73 m (240 ft) tall, completed by the Sultan of Delhi , Iltutmish The Indian early medieval age, from 600 to 1200 CE , is defined by regional kingdoms and cultural diversity. [ 111 ] When Harsha of Kannauj , who ruled much of the Indo-Gangetic Plain from 606 to 647 CE , attempted to expand southwards, he was defeated by the Chalukya ruler of the Deccan. [ 112 ] When his successor attempted to expand eastwards, he was defeated by the Pala king of Bengal . [ 112 ] When the Chalukyas attempted to expand southwards, they were defeated by the Pallavas from farther south, who in turn were opposed by the Pandyas and the Cholas from still farther south. [ 112 ] No ruler of this period was able to create an empire and consistently control lands much beyond their core region. [ 111 ] During this time, pastoral peoples, whose land had been cleared to make way for the growing agricultural economy, were accommodated within caste society, as were new non-traditional ruling classes. [ 113 ] The caste system consequently began to show regional differences. [ 113 ] In the 6th and 7th centuries, the first devotional hymns were created in the Tamil language. [ 114 ] They were imitated all over India and led to both the resurgence of Hinduism and the development of all modern languages of the subcontinent . [ 114 ] Indian royalty, big and small, and the temples they patronised drew citizens in great numbers to the capital cities, which became economic hubs as well. [ 115 ] Temple towns of various sizes began to appear everywhere as India underwent another urbanisation. [ 115 ] By the 8th and 9th centuries, the effects were felt in Southeast Asia, as South Indian culture and political systems were exported to lands that became part of modern-day Myanmar , Thailand , Laos , Brunei , Cambodia , Vietnam , Philippines , Malaysia , and Indonesia . [ 116 ] Indian merchants, scholars, and sometimes armies were involved in this transmission; Southeast Asians took the initiative as well, with many sojourning in Indian seminaries and translating Buddhist and Hindu texts into their languages. [ 116 ] After the 10th century, Muslim Central Asian nomadic clans, using swift-horse cavalry and raising vast armies united by ethnicity and religion, repeatedly overran South Asia's north-western plains, leading eventually to the establishment of the Islamic Delhi Sultanate in 1206. [ 117 ] The sultanate was to control much of North India and to make many forays into South India. Although at first disruptive for the Indian elites, the sultanate largely left its vast non-Muslim subject population to its own laws and customs. [ 118 ] [ 119 ] By repeatedly repulsing Mongol raiders in the 13th century, the sultanate saved India from the devastation visited on West and Central Asia, setting the scene for centuries of migration of fleeing soldiers, learned men, mystics, traders, artists, and artisans from that region into the subcontinent, thereby creating a syncretic Indo-Islamic culture in the north. [ 120 ] [ 121 ] The sultanate's raiding and weakening of the regional kingdoms of South India paved the way for the indigenous Vijayanagara Empire . [ 122 ] Embracing a strong Shaivite tradition and building upon the military technology of the sultanate, the empire came to control much of peninsular India, [ 123 ] and was to influence South Indian society for long afterwards. [ 122 ] Early modern India A distant view of the Taj Mahal from the Agra Fort A two- mohur Company gold coin, issued in 1835, the obverse inscribed \" William IIII , King\" In the early 16th century, northern India, then under mainly Muslim rulers, [ 124 ] fell again to the superior mobility and firepower of a new generation of Central Asian warriors. [ 125 ] The resulting Mughal Empire did not stamp out the local societies it came to rule. Instead, it balanced and pacified them through new administrative practices [ 126 ] [ 127 ] and diverse and inclusive ruling elites, [ 128 ] leading to more systematic, centralised, and uniform rule. [ 129 ] Eschewing tribal bonds and Islamic identity, especially under Akbar , the Mughals united their far-flung realms through loyalty, expressed through a Persianised culture, to an emperor who had near-divine status. [ 128 ] The Mughal state's economic policies, deriving most revenues from agriculture [ 130 ] and mandating that taxes be paid in the well-regulated silver currency, [ 131 ] caused peasants and artisans to enter larger markets. [ 129 ] The relative peace maintained by the empire during much of the 17th century was a factor in India's economic expansion, [ 129 ] resulting in greater patronage of painting , literary forms, textiles, and architecture . [ 132 ] Newly coherent social groups in northern and western India, such as the Marathas , the Rajputs , and the Sikhs , gained military and governing ambitions during Mughal rule, which, through collaboration or adversity, gave them both recognition and military experience. [ 133 ] Expanding commerce during Mughal rule gave rise to new Indian commercial and political elites along the coasts of southern and eastern India. [ 133 ] As the empire disintegrated, many among these elites were able to seek and control their own affairs. [ 134 ] By the early 18th century, with the lines between commercial and political dominance being increasingly blurred, a number of European trading companies, including the English East India Company , had established coastal outposts. [ 135 ] [ 136 ] The East India Company's control of the seas, greater resources, and more advanced military training and technology led it to increasingly assert its military strength and caused it to become attractive to a portion of the Indian elite; these factors were crucial in allowing the company to gain control over the Bengal region by 1765 and sideline the other European companies. [ 137 ] [ 135 ] [ 138 ] [ 139 ] Its further access to the riches of Bengal and the subsequent increased strength and size of its army enabled it to annexe or subdue most of India by the 1820s. [ 140 ] India was then no longer exporting manufactured goods as it long had, but was instead supplying the British Empire with raw materials. Many historians consider this to be the onset of India's colonial period. [ 135 ] By this time, with its economic power severely curtailed by the British parliament and having effectively been made an arm of British administration, the East India Company began more consciously to enter non-economic arenas, including education, social reform, and culture. [ 141 ] Modern India Main article: History of India (1947–present) A 1909 map of the British Indian Empire Jawaharlal Nehru sharing a light moment with Mahatma Gandhi , Mumbai, 6 July 1946 Historians consider India's modern age to have begun sometime between 1848 and 1885. The appointment in 1848 of Lord Dalhousie as Governor General of the East India Company set the stage for changes essential to a modern state. These included the consolidation and demarcation of sovereignty, the surveillance of the population, and the education of citizens. Technological changes—among them, railways, canals, and the telegraph—were introduced not long after their introduction in Europe . [ 142 ] [ 143 ] [ 144 ] [ 145 ] Disaffection with the company also grew during this time and set off the Indian Rebellion of 1857 . Fed by diverse resentments and perceptions, including invasive British-style social reforms, harsh land taxes, and summary treatment of some rich landowners and princes, the rebellion rocked many regions of northern and central India and shook the foundations of Company rule. [ 146 ] [ 147 ] Although the rebellion was suppressed by 1858, it led to the dissolution of the East India Company and the direct administration of India by the British government. Proclaiming a unitary state and a gradual but limited British-style parliamentary system, the new rulers also protected princes and landed gentry as a feudal safeguard against future unrest. [ 148 ] [ 149 ] In the decades following, public life gradually emerged all over India, leading eventually to the founding of the Indian National Congress in 1885. [ 150 ] [ 151 ] [ 152 ] [ 153 ] The rush of technology and the commercialisation of agriculture in the second half of the 19th century was marked by economic setbacks, and many small farmers became dependent on the whims of far-away markets. [ 154 ] There was an increase in the number of large-scale famines , [ 155 ] and, despite the risks of infrastructure development borne by Indian taxpayers, little industrial employment was generated for Indians. [ 156 ] There were also salutary effects: commercial cropping, especially in the newly canalled Punjab, led to increased food production for internal consumption. [ 157 ] The railway network provided critical famine relief, [ 158 ] notably reduced the cost of moving goods, [ 158 ] and helped nascent Indian-owned industry. [ 157 ] After World War I , in which approximately one million Indians served , [ 159 ] a new period began. It was marked by British reforms but also repressive legislation , by more strident Indian calls for self-rule, and by the beginnings of a nonviolent movement of non-co-operation, of which Mahatma Gandhi would become the leader and enduring symbol. [ 160 ] During the 1930s, slow legislative reform was enacted by the British; the Indian National Congress won victories in the resulting elections. [ 161 ] The next decade was beset with crises: Indian participation in World War II , the Congress's final push for non-co-operation, and an upsurge of Muslim nationalism . All were capped by the advent of independence in 1947, but tempered by the partition of India into two states: India and Pakistan. [ 162 ] Vital to India's self-image as an independent nation was its constitution, completed in 1950, which put in place a secular and democratic republic. [ 163 ] Economic liberalisation, which began in the 1980s and with the collaboration with Soviet Union for technical knowledge, [ 164 ] has created a large urban middle class, transformed India into one of the world's fastest-growing economies , [ 165 ] and increased its geopolitical influence. Yet, India is also shaped by persistent poverty, both rural and urban; [ 166 ] by religious and caste-related violence ; [ 167 ] by Maoist-inspired Naxalite insurgencies ; [ 168 ] and by separatism in Jammu and Kashmir and in Northeast India . [ 169 ] It has unresolved territorial disputes with China and with Pakistan . [ 170 ] India's sustained democratic freedoms are unique among the world's newer nations; however, in spite of its recent economic successes, freedom from want for its disadvantaged population remains a goal yet to be achieved. [ 171 ] As of 2025, poverty in India declined sharply, mainly due to government welfare programs. [ 172 ] Geography Main article: Geography of India The Tungabhadra , with rocky outcrops, flows into the peninsular Krishna River . [ 173 ] Fishing boats lashed together in a tidal creek in Anjarle village, Maharashtra India accounts for the bulk of the Indian subcontinent, lying atop the Indian tectonic plate , a part of the Indo-Australian Plate . [ 174 ] India's defining geological processes began 75 million years ago when the Indian Plate, then part of the southern supercontinent Gondwana , began a north-eastward drift caused by seafloor spreading to its south-west, and later, south and south-east. [ 174 ] Simultaneously, the vast Tethyan oceanic crust , to its northeast, began to subduct under the Eurasian Plate . [ 174 ] These dual processes, driven by convection in the Earth's mantle , both created the Indian Ocean and caused the Indian continental crust eventually to under-thrust Eurasia and to uplift the Himalayas . [ 174 ] Immediately south of the emerging Himalayas, plate movement created a vast crescent-shaped trough that rapidly filled with river-borne sediment [ 175 ] and now constitutes the Indo-Gangetic Plain . [ 176 ] The original Indian plate makes its first appearance above the sediment in the ancient Aravalli range , which extends from the Delhi Ridge in a southwesterly direction. To the west lies the Thar Desert , the eastern spread of which is checked by the Aravallis. [ 177 ] [ 178 ] [ 179 ] The remaining Indian Plate survives as peninsular India , the oldest and geologically most stable part of India. It extends as far north as the Satpura and Vindhya ranges in central India. These parallel chains run from the Arabian Sea coast in Gujarat in the west to the coal-rich Chota Nagpur Plateau in Jharkhand in the east. [ 180 ] To the south, the remaining peninsular landmass, the Deccan Plateau , is flanked on the west and east by coastal ranges known as the Western and Eastern Ghats ; [ 181 ] the plateau contains the country's oldest rock formations, some over one billion years old. Constituted in such fashion, India lies to the north of the equator between 6° 44′ and 35° 30′ north latitude [ m ] and 68° 7′ and 97° 25′ east longitude. [ 182 ] India's coastline measures 7,517 kilometres (4,700 mi) in length; of this distance, 5,423 kilometres (3,400 mi) belong to peninsular India and 2,094 kilometres (1,300 mi) to the Andaman, Nicobar, and Lakshadweep island chains. [ 183 ] According to the Indian naval hydrographic charts, the mainland coastline consists of the following: 43% sandy beaches; 11% rocky shores, including cliffs; and 46% mudflats or marshy shores. [ 183 ] Major Himalayan-origin rivers that substantially flow through India include the Ganges and the Brahmaputra , both of which drain into the Bay of Bengal . [ 184 ] Important tributaries of the Ganges include the Yamuna and the Kosi . The Kosi's extremely low gradient, caused by long-term silt deposition, leads to severe floods and course changes. [ 185 ] [ 186 ] Major peninsular rivers, whose steeper gradients prevent their waters from flooding, include the Godavari , the Mahanadi , the Kaveri , and the Krishna , which also drain into the Bay of Bengal; [ 187 ] and the Narmada and the Tapti , which drain into the Arabian Sea . [ 188 ] Coastal features include the marshy Rann of Kutch of western India and the alluvial Sundarbans delta of eastern India; the latter is shared with Bangladesh. [ 189 ] India has two archipelagos : the Lakshadweep , coral atolls off India's south-western coast; and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, a volcanic chain in the Andaman Sea . [ 190 ] Climate Munnar tea estates in Idukki district , a major tea-growing area of the Western Ghats. The Indian climate is strongly influenced by the Himalayas and the Thar Desert, both of which drive the economically and culturally pivotal summer and winter monsoons . [ 191 ] The Himalayas prevent cold Central Asian katabatic winds from blowing in, keeping the bulk of the Indian subcontinent warmer than most locations at similar latitudes. [ 192 ] [ 193 ] The Thar Desert plays a crucial role in attracting the moisture-laden south-west summer monsoon winds that, between June and October, provide the majority of India's rainfall. [ 191 ] Four major climatic groupings predominate in India: tropical wet , tropical dry , subtropical humid , and montane . [ 194 ] Temperatures in India have risen by 0.7 °C (1.3 °F) between 1901 and 2018. [ 195 ] Climate change in India is often thought to be the cause. The retreat of Himalayan glaciers has adversely affected the flow rate of the major Himalayan rivers, including the Ganges and the Brahmaputra . [ 196 ] According to some current projections, the number and severity of droughts in India will have markedly increased by the end of the present century. [ 197 ] Biodiversity Main articles: Forestry in India and Wildlife of India India has the majority of the world's wild tigers , approximately 3,170 in 2022. [ 198 ] A chital ( Axis axis ) stag in the Nagarhole National Park in a region covered by a moderately dense [ n ] forest Three of the last Asiatic cheetahs in India were shot dead in 1948 in Surguja district , Madhya Pradesh , Central India , by Maharajah Ramanuj Pratap Singh Deo . The young male cheetahs , all from the same litter, were sitting together when they were shot at night. India is a megadiverse country , a term employed for 17 countries that display high biological diversity and contain many species exclusively indigenous , or endemic , to them. [ 199 ] India is the habitat for 8.6% of all mammals , 13.7% of bird species, 7.9% of reptile species, 6% of amphibian species, 12.2% of fish species, and 6.0% of all flowering plant species. [ 200 ] [ 201 ] Fully a third of Indian plant species are endemic. [ 202 ] India also contains four of the world's 34 biodiversity hotspots , [ 71 ] or regions that display significant habitat loss in the presence of high endemism. [ o ] [ 203 ] India's most dense forests, such as the tropical moist forest of the Andaman Islands , the Western Ghats , and Northeast India , occupy approximately 3% of its land area. [ 204 ] [ 205 ] Moderately dense forest , whose canopy density is between 40% and 70%, occupies 9.39% of India's land area. [ 204 ] [ 205 ] It predominates in the temperate coniferous forest of the Himalayas , the moist deciduous sal forest of eastern India, and the dry deciduous teak forest of central and southern India. [ 206 ] India has two natural zones of thorn forest , one in the Deccan Plateau , immediately east of the Western Ghats, and the other in the western part of the Indo-Gangetic plain, now turned into rich agricultural land by irrigation, its features no longer visible. [ 207 ] Among the Indian subcontinent's notable indigenous trees are the astringent Azadirachta indica , or neem , which is widely used in rural Indian herbal medicine , [ 208 ] and the luxuriant Ficus religiosa , or peepul , [ 209 ] which is displayed on the ancient seals of Mohenjo-daro , [ 210 ] and under which the Buddha is recorded in the Pali canon to have sought enlightenment. [ 211 ] Many Indian species have descended from those of Gondwana , the southern supercontinent from which India separated more than 100 million years ago. [ 212 ] India's subsequent collision with Eurasia set off a mass exchange of species. However, volcanism and climatic changes later caused the extinction of many endemic Indian forms. [ 213 ] Still later, mammals entered India from Asia through two zoogeographic passes flanking the Himalayas. [ 214 ] This lowered endemism among India's mammals, which stands at 12.6%, contrasting with 45.8% among reptiles and 55.8% among amphibians. [ 201 ] Among endemics are the vulnerable [ 215 ] hooded leaf monkey [ 216 ] and the threatened Beddome's toad [ 217 ] [ 218 ] of the Western Ghats. India contains 172 IUCN -designated threatened animal species , or 2.9% of endangered forms. [ 219 ] These include the endangered Bengal tiger and the Ganges river dolphin . Critically endangered species include the gharial , a crocodilian ; the great Indian bustard ; and the Indian white-rumped vulture , which has become nearly extinct by having ingested the carrion of diclofenac -treated cattle. [ 220 ] Before they were extensively used for agriculture and cleared for human settlement, the thorn forests of Punjab were mingled at intervals with open grasslands that were grazed by large herds of blackbuck preyed on by the Asiatic cheetah ; the blackbuck, no longer extant in Punjab, is now severely endangered in India, and the cheetah is extinct. [ 221 ] The pervasive and ecologically devastating human encroachment of recent decades has critically endangered Indian wildlife. In response, the system of national parks and protected areas , first established in 1935, was expanded substantially. In 1972, India enacted the Wildlife Protection Act [ 222 ] and Project Tiger to safeguard crucial wilderness; the Forest Conservation Act was enacted in 1980 and amendments added in 1988. [ 223 ] India hosts more than five hundred wildlife sanctuaries and eighteen biosphere reserves , [ 224 ] four of which are part of the World Network of Biosphere Reserves ; its eighty-nine wetlands are registered under the Ramsar Convention . [ 225 ] Government and politics Politics Main article: Politics of India See also: Democracy in India As part of Janadesh 2007 , 25,000 pro– land reform landless people in Madhya Pradesh listen to Rajagopal P. V. [ 226 ] US president Barack Obama addresses the members of the Parliament of India in New Delhi in November 2010. India is a parliamentary republic with a multi-party system . [ 227 ] It has six recognised national parties , including the Indian National Congress (INC) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and over 50 regional parties . [ 228 ] Congress is considered the ideological centre in Indian political culture , [ 229 ] whereas the BJP is right-wing to far-right . [ 230 ] [ 231 ] [ 232 ] From 1950 to the late 1980s, Congress held a majority in India's parliament . Afterwards, it increasingly shared power with the BJP, [ 233 ] as well as with powerful regional parties, which forced multi-party coalition governments at the centre. [ 234 ] In the general elections in 1951 , 1957 , and 1962 , Congress, led by Jawaharlal Nehru , won easy victories. On Nehru's death in 1964, Lal Bahadur Shastri briefly became prime minister; he was succeeded in 1966, by Nehru's daughter Indira Gandhi , who led the Congress to election victories in 1967 and 1971 . Following public discontent with the state of emergency Indira Gandhi had declared in 1975, Congress was voted out of power in 1977 ; Janata Party , which had opposed the emergency, was voted in. Its government lasted two years; Morarji Desai and Charan Singh served as prime ministers. After Congress was returned to power in 1980, Indira Gandhi was assassinated and succeeded by Rajiv Gandhi , who won comfortably in the elections later that year . A National Front coalition led by the Janata Dal in alliance with the Left Front won the 1989 elections , with the subsequent government lasting just under two years, and V.P. Singh and Chandra Shekhar serving as prime ministers. [ 235 ] In the 1991 Indian general election , Congress, as the largest single party, formed a minority government led by P. V. Narasimha Rao . [ 236 ] After the 1996 Indian general election , the BJP formed a government briefly; it was followed by United Front coalitions, which depended on external political support. Two prime ministers served during this period: H.D. Deve Gowda and I.K. Gujral . In 1998 , the BJP formed a coalition—the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). Led by Atal Bihari Vajpayee , the NDA became the first non-Congress, coalition government to complete a five-year term. [ 237 ] In the 2004 Indian general elections , no party won an absolute majority. Still, the Congress emerged as the largest single party, forming another successful coalition: the United Progressive Alliance (UPA). It had the support of left-leaning parties and MPs who opposed the BJP. The UPA returned to power in the 2009 general election with increased numbers, and it no longer required external support from India's communist parties . [ 238 ] Manmohan Singh became the first prime minister since Jawaharlal Nehru in 1957 and 1962 to be re-elected to a consecutive five-year term. [ 239 ] In the 2014 general election , the BJP became the first political party since 1984 to win an absolute majority. [ 240 ] In the 2019 general election , the BJP regained an absolute majority. In the 2024 general election , a BJP-led NDA coalition formed the government . Narendra Modi , a former chief minister of Gujarat , is in his third term as the prime minister of India and has served in the position since 26 May 2014. [ 241 ] Government Main article: Government of India See also: Constitution of India Rashtrapati Bhavan , the official residence of the President of India , was designed by British architects Edwin Lutyens and Herbert Baker for the Viceroy of India , and constructed between 1911 and 1931 during the British Raj . [ 242 ] India is a federation with a parliamentary system governed under the Constitution of India . Federalism in India defines the power distribution between the union and the states . India's form of government, traditionally described as \"quasi-federal\" with a strong centre and weak states, [ 243 ] has grown increasingly federal since the late 1990s as a result of political, economic, and social changes. [ 244 ] [ 245 ] The Government of India comprises three branches: the Executive , Legislature , and Judiciary . [ 246 ] The President of India is the ceremonial head of state , [ 247 ] who is elected indirectly for a five-year term by an electoral college comprising members of national and state legislatures. [ 248 ] [ 249 ] The Prime Minister of India is the head of government and exercises most executive power . [ 250 ] Appointed by the president, [ 251 ] the prime minister is supported by the party or political alliance with a majority of seats in the lower house of parliament. [ 250 ] The executive of the Indian government consists of the president, the vice-president , and the Union Council of Ministers —with the cabinet being its executive committee—headed by the prime minister. Any minister holding a portfolio must be a member of one of the houses of parliament. [ 247 ] In the Indian parliamentary system, the executive is subordinate to the legislature; the prime minister and their council are directly responsible to the lower house of the parliament. Civil servants act as permanent executives and all decisions of the executive are implemented by them. [ 252 ] The legislature of India is the bicameral parliament . Operating under a Westminster-style parliamentary system, it comprises an upper house called the Rajya Sabha (Council of States) and a lower house called the Lok Sabha (House of the People). [ 253 ] The Rajya Sabha is a permanent body of 245 members who serve staggered six-year terms with elections every 2 years. [ 254 ] Most are elected indirectly by the state and union territorial legislatures in numbers proportional to their state's share of the national population. [ 251 ] The Lok Sabha's 543 members are elected directly by popular vote among citizens aged at least 18; [ 255 ] they represent single-member constituencies for five-year terms. [ 256 ] Several seats from each state are reserved for candidates from Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in proportion to their population within that state. [ 255 ] India has a three-tier unitary independent judiciary [ 257 ] comprising the supreme court , headed by the Chief Justice of India , 25 high courts , and a large number of trial courts. [ 257 ] The supreme court has original jurisdiction over cases involving fundamental rights and over disputes between states and the centre and has appellate jurisdiction over the high courts. [ 258 ] It has the power to both strike down union or state laws which contravene the constitution [ 259 ] and invalidate any government action it deems unconstitutional. [ 260 ] Administrative divisions Main article: Administrative divisions of India See also: Political integration of India A clickable map of the 28 states and 8 union territories of India India is a federal union comprising 28 states and 8 union territories . [ 12 ] All states, as well as the union territories of Jammu and Kashmir , Puducherry and the National Capital Territory of Delhi , have elected legislatures and governments following the Westminster system . The remaining five union territories are directly ruled by the central government through appointed administrators. In 1956, under the States Reorganisation Act , states were reorganised on a linguistic basis. [ 261 ] There are over a quarter of a million local government bodies at city, town, block, district and village levels. [ 262 ] States Andhra Pradesh Arunachal Pradesh Assam Bihar Chhattisgarh Goa Gujarat Haryana Himachal Pradesh Jharkhand Karnataka Kerala Madhya Pradesh Maharashtra Manipur Meghalaya Mizoram Nagaland Odisha Punjab Rajasthan Sikkim Tamil Nadu Telangana Tripura Uttar Pradesh Uttarakhand West Bengal Union territories Andaman and Nicobar Islands Chandigarh Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu Jammu and Kashmir Ladakh Lakshadweep National Capital Territory of Delhi Puducherry Foreign relations Main article: Foreign relations of India In the 1950s and 60s, India played a pivotal role in the Non-Aligned Movement . [ 263 ] From left to right: Gamal Abdel Nasser of United Arab Republic (now Egypt), Josip Broz Tito of Yugoslavia and Jawaharlal Nehru in Belgrade, September 1961. India became a republic in 1950, remaining a member of the Commonwealth of Nations . [ 264 ] [ 265 ] India strongly supported decolonisation in Africa and Asia in the 1950s; it played a leading role in the Non-Aligned Movement. [ 266 ] After initially cordial relations, India suffered a humiliating military defeat to China in a 1962 war . [ 267 ] Another military conflict followed in 1967 in which India successfully repelled a Chinese attack. [ 268 ] India has had uneasy relations with its western neighbour, Pakistan . The two countries went to war in 1947 , 1965 , 1971 , and 1999 . Three of these wars were fought over the disputed territory of Kashmir . In contrast, the 1971 war followed India's support for the independence of Bangladesh . [ 269 ] After the 1965 war with Pakistan, India began to pursue close military and economic ties with the Soviet Union . By the late 1960s, the Soviet Union was its largest arms supplier. [ 270 ] India has played a key role in the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation and the World Trade Organization . The nation has supplied 100,000 military and police personnel in 35 UN peacekeeping operations . [ citation needed ] China's nuclear test of 1964 and threats to intervene in support of Pakistan in the 1965 war caused India to produce nuclear weapons. [ 271 ] India conducted its first nuclear weapons test in 1974 and carried out additional underground testing in 1998. India has signed neither the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty nor the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty , considering both to be flawed and discriminatory. [ 272 ] India maintains a \" no first use \" nuclear policy and is developing a nuclear triad capability as a part of its \" Minimum Credible Deterrence \" doctrine. [ 273 ] [ 274 ] Since the end of the Cold War , India has increased its economic, strategic, and military cooperation with the United States and the European Union . [ 275 ] In 2008, a civilian nuclear agreement was signed between India and the United States. Although India possessed nuclear weapons at the time and was not a party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, it received waivers from the International Atomic Energy Agency and the Nuclear Suppliers Group , ending earlier restrictions on India's nuclear technology and commerce; India subsequently signed co-operation agreements involving civilian nuclear energy with Russia, [ 276 ] France, [ 277 ] the United Kingdom , [ 278 ] and Canada . [ 279 ] Military Main article: Indian Armed Forces The Indian Air Force contingent marching at the 221st Bastille Day military parade in Paris, July 2009. The parade at which India was the foreign guest was led by India's oldest regiment, the Maratha Light Infantry , founded in 1768. [ 280 ] The President of India is the supreme commander of the nation's armed forces. With 1.45 million active troops, they are the world's second-largest military . It comprises the Indian Army , the Indian Navy , the Indian Air Force , and the Indian Coast Guard . [ 281 ] The official Indian defence budget for 2011 was US$36.03 billion, or 1.83% of GDP. [ 282 ] Defence expenditure was pegged at US$70.12 billion for fiscal year 2022–23 and, increased 9.8% on the previous fiscal year. [ 283 ] [ 284 ] India is the world's second-largest arms importer; between 2016 and 2020, it accounted for 9.5% of the total global arms imports. [ 285 ] Much of the military expenditure was focused on defence against Pakistan and countering growing Chinese influence in the Indian Ocean. [ 286 ] Economy Main article: Economy of India In 2019, 43% of India's total workforce was employed in agriculture. [ 287 ] India is the world's largest producer of milk , with the largest population of cattle.  In 2018, nearly 80% of India's milk was sourced from small farms with herd size between one and two, the milk harvested by hand milking. [ 289 ] 55% of India's female workforce was employed in agriculture in 2019. [ 288 ] According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Indian economy in 2024 was nominally worth $3.94 trillion; it is the fifth-largest economy by market exchange rates and is, at around $15.0 trillion, the third-largest by purchasing power parity (PPP). [ 16 ] With its average annual GDP growth rate of 5.8% over the past two decades, and reaching 6.1% during 2011–2012, [ 290 ] India is one of the world's fastest-growing economies . [ 291 ] However, due to its low GDP per capita—which ranks 136th in the world in nominal per capita income and 125th in per capita income adjusted for purchasing power parity (PPP)—the vast majority of Indians fall into the low-income group. [ 292 ] [ 293 ] Until 1991, all Indian governments followed protectionist policies that were influenced by socialist economics. Widespread state intervention and regulation largely walled the economy off from the outside world. An acute balance of payments crisis in 1991 forced the nation to liberalise its economy ; [ 294 ] since then, it has moved increasingly towards a free-market system [ 295 ] [ 296 ] by emphasising both foreign trade and direct investment inflows. [ 297 ] India has been a member of World Trade Organization since 1 January 1995. [ 298 ] The 522-million-worker Indian labour force is the world's second largest , as of 2017 [update] . [ 281 ] The service sector makes up 55.6% of GDP, the industrial sector 26.3% and the agricultural sector 18.1%. India's foreign exchange remittances of US$100 billion in 2022, [ 299 ] highest in the world, were contributed to its economy by 32 million Indians working in foreign countries. [ 300 ] In 2006, the share of external trade in India's GDP stood at 24%, up from 6% in 1985. [ 295 ] In 2008, India's share of world trade was 1.7%; [ 301 ] In 2021, India was the world's ninth-largest importer and the sixteenth-largest exporter . [ 302 ] Between 2001 and 2011, the contribution of petrochemical and engineering goods to total exports grew from 14% to 42%. [ 303 ] India was the world's second-largest textile exporter after China in the 2013 calendar year. [ 304 ] Averaging an economic growth rate of 7.5% for several years before 2007, [ 295 ] India has more than doubled its hourly wage rates during the first decade of the 21st century. [ 305 ] Some 431 million Indians have left poverty since 1985; India's middle classes are projected to number around 580 million by 2030. [ 306 ] In 2024, India's consumer market was the world's third largest . [ 307 ] India's nominal GDP per capita increased steadily from US$308 in 1991, when economic liberalisation began, to US$1,380 in 2010, to an estimated US$2,731 in 2024. It is expected to grow to US$3,264 by 2026. [ 16 ] Industries A tea garden in Sikkim. India, the world's second-largest producer of tea , is a nation of one billion tea drinkers, who consume 70% of India's tea output. The Indian automotive industry , the world's second-fastest growing, increased domestic sales by 26% during 2009–2010, [ 308 ] and exports by 36% during 2008–2009. [ 309 ] In 2022, India became the world's third-largest vehicle market after China and the United States, surpassing Japan. [ 310 ] At the end of 2011, the Indian IT industry employed 2.8 million professionals, generated revenues close to US$100 billion equalling 7.5% of Indian GDP, and contributed 26% of India's merchandise exports. [ 311 ] The pharmaceutical industry in India includes 3,000 pharmaceutical companies and 10,500 manufacturing units; India is the world's third-largest pharmaceutical producer, largest producer of generic medicines and supply up to 50–60% of global vaccines demand, these all contribute up to US$ 24.44 billions in exports and India's local pharmaceutical market is estimated up to US$ 42 billion. [ 312 ] [ 313 ] India is among the top 12 biotech destinations in the world. [ 314 ] [ 315 ] The Indian biotech industry grew by 15.1% in 2012–2013, increasing its revenues from ₹ 204.4 billion ( Indian rupees ) to ₹ 235.24 billion (US$3.94 billion at June 2013 exchange rates). [ 316 ] Energy Main article: Energy in India See also: Energy policy of India India's capacity to generate electrical power is 300 gigawatts, of which 42 gigawatts is renewable. [ 317 ] The country's usage of coal is a major cause of India's greenhouse gas emissions , but its renewable energy is competing strongly. [ 318 ] [ better source needed ] India emits about 7% of global greenhouse gas emissions. This equates to about 2.5 tons of carbon dioxide per person per year, which is half the world average. [ 319 ] [ 320 ] Increasing access to electricity and clean cooking with liquefied petroleum gas have been priorities for energy in India. [ 321 ] Socio-economic challenges Main articles: Poverty in India , Income inequality in India , and Debt bondage in India Health workers about to begin another day of immunisation against infectious diseases in 2006.  Eight years later, and three years after India's last case of polio, the World Health Organization declared India to be polio-free. [ 322 ] Despite economic growth during recent decades, India continues to face socio-economic challenges. In 2006, India contained the largest number of people living below the World Bank 's international poverty line of US$1.25 per day. [ 323 ] The proportion decreased from 60% in 1981 to 42% in 2005. [ 324 ] Under the World Bank's later revised poverty line, it was 21%-22.5 in 2011. [ p ] [ 326 ] [ 327 ] In 2019, the estimates had gone down to 10.2%. [ 327 ] In 2014, 30.7% of India's children under the age of five were underweight. [ 328 ] According to a Food and Agriculture Organization report in 2015, 15% of the population was undernourished. [ 329 ] [ 330 ] The Midday Meal Scheme attempts to lower these rates. [ 331 ] A 2018 Walk Free Foundation report estimated that nearly 8 million people in India were living in different forms of modern slavery , such as bonded labour , child labour , human trafficking, and forced begging. [ 332 ] According to the 2011 census, there were 10.1 million child labourers in the country, a decline of 2.6 million from 12.6 million in 2001. [ 333 ] Since 1991, economic inequality between India's states has consistently grown: the per-capita net state domestic product of the richest states in 2007 was 3.2 times that of the poorest. [ 334 ] Corruption in India is perceived to have decreased. According to the Corruption Perceptions Index , India ranked 78th out of 180 countries in 2018, an improvement from 85th in 2014. [ 335 ] [ 336 ] As of 2025, poverty in India declined sharply. According to the World Bank report, extreme poverty fall from 16.2% in 2011-12 to 2.3% in 2022-23. In rural areas it fell from 18.4% to 2.8%, and in urban areas, from 10.7% to 1.1%. 378 million peopole were lifted from poverty and 171 million from extreme poverty. The main reason, according to the World Bank, is not economic growth but different government welfare programs, like transferring food and money to the people with low income, improving their access to services. [ 172 ] Demographics Main article: Demographics of India See also: South Asian ethnic groups A Sikh pilgrim at the Harmandir Sahib , or Golden Temple, in Amritsar , Punjab The interior of San Thome Basilica , Chennai , Tamil Nadu .  Christianity is believed to have been introduced to India by the late 2nd century by Syriac-speaking Christians . With an estimated 1,428,627,663 residents in 2023, India is the world's most populous country. [ 13 ] 1,210,193,422 residents were reported in the 2011 provisional census report . [ 337 ] Its population grew by 17.64% from 2001 to 2011, [ 338 ] compared to 21.54% growth in the previous decade (1991–2001). [ 338 ] The human sex ratio, according to the 2011 census, is 940 females per 1,000 males. [ 337 ] The median age was 28.7 in 2020. [ 281 ] The first post-colonial census, conducted in 1951, counted 361 million people. [ 339 ] Medical advances made in the last 50 years as well as increased agricultural productivity brought about by the \" Green Revolution \" have caused India's population to grow rapidly. [ 340 ] The life expectancy in India is 70 years to 71.5 years for women, and 68.7 years for men. [ 281 ] There are around 93 physicians per 100,000 people. [ 341 ] Urbanisation Main article: Urbanisation in India Migration from rural to urban areas has been an important dynamic in India's recent history. The number of people living in urban areas grew by 31.2% between 1991 and 2001. [ 342 ] In 2001, over 70% lived in rural areas. [ 343 ] [ 344 ] The level of urbanisation increased further from 27.81% in the 2001 census to 31.16% in the 2011 census. The slowing down of the overall population growth rate was due to the sharp decline in the growth rate in rural areas since 1991. [ 345 ] In the 2011 census, there were 53 million-plus urban agglomerations in India . Among them Mumbai , Delhi , Kolkata , Chennai , Bengaluru , Hyderabad and Ahmedabad , in decreasing order by population. [ 346 ] Languages Main article: Languages of India Among speakers of the Indian languages , 74% speak Indo-Aryan languages , the easternmost branch of the Indo-European languages ; 24% speak Dravidian languages , indigenous to South Asia and spoken widely before the spread of Indo-Aryan languages and 2% speak Austroasiatic languages or the Sino-Tibetan languages . India has no national language. [ 347 ] Hindi , with the largest number of speakers, is the official language of the government. [ 348 ] [ 349 ] English is used extensively in business and administration and has the status of a \"subsidiary official language\"; [ 6 ] it is important in education , especially as a medium of higher education. Each state and union territory has one or more official languages, and the constitution recognises in particular 22 \"scheduled languages\". Religion Main article: Religion in India The 2011 census reported the religion in India with the largest number of followers was Hinduism (79.80% of the population), followed by Islam (14.23%); the remaining were Christianity (2.30%), Sikhism (1.72%), Buddhism (0.70%), Jainism (0.36%) and others [ q ] (0.9%). [ 11 ] India has the third-largest Muslim population —the largest for a non-Muslim majority country. [ 350 ] [ 351 ] Education Main article: Education in India See also: Literacy in India and History of education in the Indian subcontinent Children awaiting school lunch in Rayka (also Raika), a village in rural Gujarat. The salutation Jai Bhim written on the blackboard honours the jurist, social reformer, and Dalit leader B. R. Ambedkar . The literacy rate in 2011 was 74.04%: 65.46% among females and 82.14% among males. [ 352 ] The rural-urban literacy gap, which was 21.2 percentage points in 2001, dropped to 16.1 percentage points in 2011. The improvement in the rural literacy rate is twice that of urban areas. [ 345 ] Kerala is the most literate state with 93.91% literacy; while Bihar the least with 63.82%. [ 352 ] In the 2011 census, about 73% of the population was literate, with 81% for men and 65% for women. This compares to 1981 when the respective rates were 41%, 53% and 29%. In 1951, the rates were 18%, 27% and 9%. In 1921, the rates 7%, 12% and 2%. In 1891, they were 5%, 9% and 1%, [ 353 ] [ 354 ] According to Latika Chaudhary, in 1911 there were under three primary schools for every ten villages. Statistically, more caste and religious diversity reduced private spending. Primary schools taught literacy, so local diversity limited its growth. [ 355 ] The education system of India is the world's second-largest. [ 356 ] India has over 900 universities, 40,000 colleges [ 357 ] and 1.5 million schools. [ 358 ] In India's higher education system, a significant number of seats are reserved under affirmative action policies for the historically disadvantaged. In recent decades India's improved education system is often cited as one of the main contributors to its economic development . [ 359 ] [ 360 ] Health Main article: Health in India The life expectancy at birth has increased from 49.7 years in 1970–1975 to 72.0 years in 2023. [ 361 ] [ 362 ] The under-five mortality rate for the country was 113 per 1,000 live births in 1994 whereas in 2018 it reduced to 41.1 per 1,000 live births. [ 361 ] India bears a disproportionately large burden of the world's tuberculosis rates, with World Health Organization (WHO) statistics for 2022 estimating 2.8 million new infections annually, accounting for 26% of the global total. [ 363 ] It is estimated that approximately 40% of the population of India carry tuberculosis infection. [ 364 ] In 2018 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was the leading cause of death after heart disease . The 10 most polluted cities in the world are all in northern India with more than 140 million people breathing air 10 times or more over the WHO safe limit. In 2017, air pollution killed 1.24 million Indians. [ 365 ] Culture Main article: Culture of India Society Main articles: Caste system in India and Gender inequality in India Muslims offer namaz at a mosque in Srinagar , Jammu and Kashmir. The Indian caste system embodies much of the social stratification and many of the social restrictions found on the Indian subcontinent. Social classes are defined by thousands of endogamous hereditary groups, often termed as jātis , or \"castes\". [ 366 ] India abolished untouchability in 1950 with the adoption of the constitution and has since enacted other anti-discriminatory laws and social welfare initiatives. [ r ] However, the system continues to be dominant in India, and caste-based inequality, discrimination, segregation, and violence persist. [ 368 ] [ 369 ] Multi-generational patrilineal joint families have been the norm in India, though nuclear families are becoming common in urban areas. [ 370 ] An overwhelming majority of Indians have their marriages arranged by their parents or other family elders. [ 371 ] Marriage is thought to be for life, [ 371 ] and the divorce rate is extremely low, [ 372 ] with less than one in a thousand marriages ending in divorce. [ 373 ] Child marriages are common, especially in rural areas; many women wed before reaching 18, which is their legal marriageable age. [ 374 ] Female infanticide in India , and lately female foeticide , have created skewed gender ratios; the number of missing women in the country quadrupled from 15 million to 63 million in the 50 years ending in 2014, faster than the population growth during the same period. [ 375 ] According to an Indian government study, an additional 21 million girls are unwanted and do not receive adequate care. [ 376 ] Despite a government ban on sex-selective foeticide, the practice remains commonplace in India, the result of a preference for boys in a patriarchal society. [ 377 ] The payment of dowry , although illegal , remains widespread across class lines. [ 378 ] Deaths resulting from dowry , mostly from bride burning , are on the rise, despite stringent anti-dowry laws. [ 379 ] Visual art Main article: Indian art India has a very ancient tradition of art, which has exchanged many influences with the rest of Eurasia , especially in the first millennium, when Buddhist art spread with Indian religions to Central , East and Southeast Asia , the last also greatly influenced by Hindu art. [ 380 ] Thousands of seals from the Indus Valley civilisation of the third millennium BCE have been found, usually carved with animals, but also some with human figures. The Pashupati seal , excavated in Mohenjo-daro , Pakistan, in 1928–29, is the best known. [ 381 ] [ 382 ] After this there is a long period with virtually nothing surviving. [ 382 ] [ 383 ] Almost all surviving ancient Indian art thereafter is in various forms of religious sculpture in durable materials, or coins. There was probably originally far more in wood, which is lost. In north India Mauryan art is the first imperial movement. [ 384 ] [ 385 ] [ 386 ] In the first millennium CE, Buddhist art spread with Indian religions to Central , East and Southeast Asia , the last also greatly influenced by Hindu art . [ 387 ] Over the following centuries a distinctly Indian style of sculpting the human figure developed, with less interest in articulating precise anatomy than ancient Greek sculpture but showing smoothly flowing forms expressing prana (\"breath\" or life-force). [ 388 ] [ 389 ] This is often complicated by the need to give figures multiple arms or heads, or represent different genders on the left and right of figures, as with the Ardhanarishvara form of Shiva and Parvati . [ 390 ] [ 391 ] Most of the earliest large sculpture is Buddhist, either excavated from Buddhist stupas such as Sanchi , Sarnath and Amaravati , [ 392 ] or is rock cut reliefs at sites such as Ajanta , Karla and Ellora . Hindu and Jain sites appear rather later. [ 393 ] [ 394 ] In spite of this complex mixture of religious traditions, generally, the prevailing artistic style at any time and place has been shared by the major religious groups, and sculptors probably usually served all communities. [ 395 ] Gupta art , at its peak c. 300 CE – c. 500 CE , is often regarded as a classical period whose influence lingered for many centuries after; it saw a new dominance of Hindu sculpture, as at the Elephanta Caves . [ 396 ] [ 397 ] Across the north, this became rather stiff and formulaic after c. 800 CE , though rich with finely carved detail in the surrounds of statues. [ 398 ] But in the South, under the Pallava and Chola dynasties , sculpture in both stone and bronze had a sustained period of great achievement ; the large bronzes with Shiva as Nataraja have become an iconic symbol of India. [ 399 ] [ 400 ] Ancient paintings have only survived at a few sites, of which the crowded scenes of court life in the Ajanta Caves are some of the most important. [ 401 ] [ 402 ] Painted manuscripts of religious texts survive from Eastern India from 10th century onwards, most of the earliest being Buddhist and later Jain. These significantly influenced later artistic styles. [ 403 ] The Persian-derived Deccan painting , starting just before the Mughal miniature , between them give the first large body of secular painting, with an emphasis on portraits, and the recording of princely pleasures and wars. [ 404 ] [ 405 ] The style spread to Hindu courts, especially among the Rajputs , and developed a variety of styles, with the smaller courts often the most innovative, with figures such as Nihâl Chand and Nainsukh . [ 406 ] [ 407 ] As a market developed among European residents, it was supplied by Company painting by Indian artists with considerable Western influence. [ 408 ] [ 409 ] In the 19th century, cheap Kalighat paintings of gods and everyday life, done on paper, were urban folk art from Calcutta , which later saw the Bengal School of Art , reflecting the art colleges founded by the British, the first movement in modern Indian painting .

[ 412 ] For women it took the form of a sari , a single piece of cloth many yards long. [ 412 ] The sari was traditionally wrapped around the lower body and the shoulder. [ 412 ] In its modern form, it is combined with an underskirt, or Indian petticoat , and tucked in the waist band for more secure fastening. It is also commonly worn with an Indian blouse , or choli , which serves as the primary upper-body garment, the sari's end—passing over the shoulder—covering the midriff and obscuring the upper body's contours. [ 412 ] For men, a similar but shorter length of cloth, the dhoti , has served as a lower-body garment. [ 413 ] The use of stitched clothes became widespread after Muslim rule was established at first by the Delhi sultanate ( c. 1300 CE ) and then continued by the Mughal Empire ( c. 1525 CE ). [ 414 ] Among the garments introduced during this time and still commonly worn are: the shalwars and pyjamas , both styles of trousers, and the tunics kurta and kameez . [ 414 ] In southern India, the traditional draped garments were to see much longer continuous use. [ 414 ] Salwars are atypically wide at the waist but narrow to a cuffed bottom. They are held up by a drawstring, which causes them to become pleated around the waist. [ 415 ] The pants can be wide and baggy, or they can be cut quite narrow, on the bias , in which case they are called churidars . When they are ordinarily wide at the waist and their bottoms are hemmed but not cuffed, they are called pyjamas. The kameez is a long shirt or tunic, [ 416 ] its side seams left open below the waistline. [ 417 ] The kurta is traditionally collarless and made of cotton or silk; it is worn plain or with embroidered decoration, such as chikan ; and typically falls to either just above or just below the wearer's knees. [ 418 ] In the last 50 years, fashions have changed a great deal in India. Increasingly, in urban northern India, the sari is no longer the apparel of everyday wear, though they remain popular on formal occasions. [ 419 ] The traditional shalwar kameez is rarely worn by younger urban women, who favour churidars or jeans. [ 419 ] In office settings, ubiquitous air conditioning allows men to wear sports jackets year-round. [ 419 ] For weddings and formal occasions, men in the middle and upper classes often wear bandgala , or short Nehru jackets , with pants, with the groom and his groomsmen sporting sherwanis and churidars. [ 419 ] The dhoti, once the universal garment of Hindu males, the wearing of which in the homespun and handwoven khadi allowed Gandhi to bring Indian nationalism to the millions, [ 420 ] is seldom seen in the cities. [ 419 ] Cuisine Main article: Indian cuisine South Indian vegetarian thali , or platter The foundation of a typical Indian meal is a cereal cooked plainly and complemented with flavourful savoury dishes. [ 421 ] The cooked cereal could be steamed rice; chapati , a thin unleavened bread; [ 422 ] the idli , a steamed breakfast cake; or dosa , a griddled pancake. [ 423 ] The savoury dishes might include lentils , pulses and vegetables commonly spiced with ginger and garlic , but also with a combination of spices that may include coriander , cumin , turmeric , cinnamon , cardamon and others. [ 421 ] They might also include poultry, fish, or meat dishes. In some instances, the ingredients may be mixed during the cooking process. [ 424 ] A platter, or thali , used for eating usually has a central place reserved for the cooked cereal, and peripheral ones for the flavourful accompaniments. The cereal and its accompaniments are eaten simultaneously rather than a piecemeal manner. This is accomplished by mixing—for example of rice and lentils—or folding, wrapping, scooping or dipping—such as chapati and cooked vegetables. [ 421 ] A tandoor chef in the Turkman Gate , Old Delhi , makes Khameeri roti (a Muslim-influenced style of leavened bread ). [ 425 ] India has distinctive vegetarian cuisines, each a feature of the geographical and cultural histories of its adherents. [ 426 ] About 20% to 39% of India's population consists of vegetarians. [ 427 ] [ 428 ] Much of this stems from caste hierarchy , as upper castes, such as the Brahmins , consider vegetarian food to be \"pure\". [ 429 ] [ 430 ] Although meat is eaten widely in India, the proportional consumption of meat in the overall diet is low. [ 431 ] Unlike China, which has increased its per capita meat consumption substantially in its years of increased economic growth, in India the strong dietary traditions have contributed to dairy, rather than meat, becoming the preferred form of animal protein consumption. [ 432 ] The most significant import of cooking techniques into India during the last millennium occurred during the Mughal Empire . Dishes such as the pilaf , [ 433 ] developed in the Abbasid caliphate , [ 434 ] and cooking techniques such as the marinating of meat in yogurt, spread into northern India from regions to its northwest. [ 435 ] To the simple yogurt marinade of Persia, onions, garlic, almonds, and spices began to be added in India. [ 435 ] Rice was partially cooked and layered alternately with the sauteed meat, the pot sealed tightly, and slow cooked according to another Persian cooking technique, to produce what has today become biryani , [ 435 ] a feature of festive dining in many parts of India. [ 436 ] In the food served in Indian restaurants worldwide, the diversity of Indian food has been partially concealed by the dominance of Punjabi cuisine . The popularity of tandoori chicken —cooked in the tandoor oven, which had traditionally been used for baking bread in the rural Punjab and the Delhi region, especially among Muslims, but which is originally from Central Asia —dates to the 1950s, and was caused in large part by an entrepreneurial response among people from the Punjab who had been displaced by the 1947 partition. [ 426 ] Sports Main article: Sport in India See also: Indian physical culture Girls play hopscotch in Jaora , Madhya Pradesh.  Hopscotch has been commonly played by girls in rural India. [ 437 ] Several traditional sports —such as kabaddi , kho kho , pehlwani , gilli-danda , hopscotch and martial arts such as Kalarippayattu and marma adi — remain popular. Chess is commonly held to have originated in India as chaturaṅga ; [ 438 ] in recent years, [ when? ] there has been a rise in the number of Indian grandmasters [ 439 ] and world champions. [ 440 ] Parcheesi is derived from Pachisi , another traditional Indian pastime, which in early modern times was played on a giant marble court by Mughal emperor Akbar the Great . [ 441 ] Cricket is the most popular sport in India. [ 442 ] India has won two Cricket World Cups , the 1983 edition and the 2011 edition . India has won eight field hockey gold medals in the summer Olympics .

[ 1 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] States and union territories can have a different official language of their own other than Hindi or English. ^ Not all the state-level official languages are in the eighth schedule and not all the scheduled languages are state-level official languages. For example, the Sindhi language is an 8th scheduled but not a state-level official language. ^ Kashmiri and Dogri language are the official languages of Jammu and Kashmir which is currently a union territory and no longer the former state . ^ According to Ethnologue , there are 424 living indigenous languages in India, in contrast to 11 extinct indigenous languages. In addition, there are 30 living non-indigenous languages. [ 10 ] Different sources give widely differing figures, primarily based on how the terms \"language\" and \"dialect\" are defined and grouped. ^ \"The country's exact size is subject to debate because some borders are disputed. The Indian government lists the total area as 3,287,260 km 2 (1,269,220 sq mi) and the total land area as 3,060,500 km 2 (1,181,700 sq mi); the United Nations lists the total area as 3,287,263 km 2 (1,269,219 sq mi) and total land area as 2,973,190 km 2 (1,147,960 sq mi).\" [ 12 ] ^ See Date and time notation in India . ^ ISO : Bhārat Gaṇarājya ^ The Government of India also regards Afghanistan as a bordering country, as it considers all of Kashmir to be part of India. [ 25 ] However, this is disputed , and the region bordering Afghanistan is administered by Pakistan. ^ \"A Chinese pilgrim also recorded evidence of the caste system as he could observe it. According to this evidence the treatment meted out to untouchables such as the Chandalas was very similar to that which they experienced in later periods. This would contradict assertions that this rigid form of the caste system emerged in India only as a reaction to the Islamic conquest.\" [ 40 ] ^ The northernmost point under Indian control is the disputed Siachen Glacier in Jammu and Kashmir ; however, the Government of India regards the entire region of the former princely state of Jammu and Kashmir, including the Gilgit-Baltistan administered by Pakistan, to be its territory. It therefore assigns the latitude 37° 6′ to its northernmost point. ^ A forest cover is moderately dense if between 40% and 70% of its area is covered by its tree canopy. ^ A biodiversity hotspot is a biogeographical region which has more than 1,500 vascular plant species, but less than 30% of its primary habitat. [ 203 ] ^ In 2015, the World Bank raised its international poverty line to $1.90 per day. [ 325 ] ^ Besides specific religions, the last two categories in the 2011 census were \"Other religions and persuasions\" (0.65%) and \"Religion not stated\" (0.23%). ^ \"Untouchability\" is abolished and its practice in any form is forbidden.

One of these is the idea of India as 'the world's largest democracy', but a democracy forged less by the creation of representative institutions and expanding electorate under British rule than by the endeavours of India's founding fathers – Gandhi, Nehru, Patel and Ambedkar – and the labours of the Constituent Assembly between 1946 and 1949, embodied in the Indian constitution of 1950. This democratic order, reinforced by the regular holding of nationwide elections and polling for the state assemblies, has, it can be argued, consistently underpinned a fundamentally democratic state structure – despite the anomaly of the Emergency and the apparent durability of the Gandhi-Nehru dynasty. ^ Fisher 2018 , pp. 184–185: \"Since 1947, India's internal disputes over its national identity, while periodically bitter and occasionally punctuated by violence, have been largely managed with remarkable and sustained commitment to national unity and democracy.\" ^ \"Ministry of Home Affairs (Department of Border Management)\" (PDF) .

This ensured an impeccable textual transmission superior to the classical texts of other cultures; it is in fact something of a tape-recording of ca. 1500–500 BCE. Not just the actual words, but even the long-lost musical (tonal) accent (as in old Greek or in Japanese) has been preserved up to the present.

The culture is called Aryan, and evidence in its texts indicates that it spread slowly south-east, following the course of the Yamuna and Ganga Rivers. Its elite called itself Arya (pure) and distinguished themselves sharply from others. Aryans led kin groups organized as nomadic horse-herding tribes. Their ritual texts are called Vedas, composed in Sanskrit. Vedic Sanskrit is recorded only in hymns that were part of Vedic rituals to Aryan gods. To be Aryan apparently meant to belong to the elite among pastoral tribes. Texts that record Aryan culture are not precisely datable, but they seem to begin around 1200 BCE with four collections of Vedic hymns (Rg, Sama, Yajur, and Artharva).\" Dyson 2018 , pp. 14–15 : \"Although the collapse of the Indus valley civilisation is no longer believed to have been due to an 'Aryan invasion' it is widely thought that, at roughly the same time, or perhaps a few centuries later, new Indo-Aryan-speaking people and influences began to enter the subcontinent from the north-west. Detailed evidence is lacking. Nevertheless, a predecessor of the language that would eventually be called Sanskrit was probably introduced into the north-west sometime between 3,900 and 3,000 years ago. This language was related to one then spoken in eastern Iran; and both of these languages belonged to the Indo-European language family. [...] It seems likely that various small-scale migrations were involved in the gradual introduction of the predecessor language and associated cultural characteristics. However, there may not have been a tight relationship between movements of people on the one hand, and changes in language and culture on the other. Moreover, the process whereby a dynamic new force gradually arose—a people with a distinct ideology who eventually seem to have referred to themselves as 'Arya'—was certainly two-way. That is, it involved a blending of new features which came from outside with other features—probably including some surviving Harappan influences—that were already present. Anyhow, it would be quite a few centuries before Sanskrit was written down. And the hymns and stories of the Arya people—especially the Vedas and the later Mahabharata and Ramayana epics—are poor guides as to historical events. Of course, the emerging Arya were to have a huge impact on the history of the subcontinent. Nevertheless, little is known about their early presence.\" Robb 2011 , pp. 46– : \"The expansion of Aryan culture is supposed to have begun around 1500 BCE. It should not be thought that this Aryan emergence (though it implies some migration) necessarily meant either a sudden invasion of new peoples, or a complete break with earlier traditions.

Gods like Viṣṇu and Śiva (under the name Rudra), who will become so dominant later, are already present in the Ṛgveda, though in roles both lesser than and different from those they will later play, and the principal Ṛgvedic gods like Indra remain in later Hinduism, though in diminished capacity.\" Flood 2020 , p. 4, see note 4: \"I take the term 'Hinduism' to meaningfully denote a range and history of practice characterised by a number of features, particularly reference to Vedic textual and sacrificial origins, belonging to endogamous social units ( jāti / varṇa ), participating in practices that involve making an offering to a deity and receiving a blessing ( pūjā ), and a first-level cultural polytheism (although many Hindus adhere to a second-level monotheism in which many gods are regarded as emanations or manifestations of the one, supreme being).\" Michaels 2017 , p. 86: \"Almost all traditional Hindu families observe until today at least three samskaras (initiation, marriage, and death ritual). Most other rituals have lost their popularity, are combined with other rites of passage, or are drastically shortened. Although samskaras vary from region to region, from class ( varna ) to class, and from caste to caste, their core elements remain the same owing to the common source, the Veda, and a common priestly tradition preserved by the Brahmin priests.\" Flood 1996 , p. 35: \"It is this Sanskrit, vedic, tradition which has maintained a continuity into modern times and which has provided the most important resource and inspiration for Hindu traditions and individuals.  The Veda is the foundation for most later developments in what is known as Hinduism.\" ^ Dyson 2018 , pp. 16 , 25 . ^ Dyson 2018 , p. 16 . ^ Fisher 2018 , p. 59 . ^ Dyson 2018 , pp. 16–17 .

Just as the symbolic content of Mughal architecture peaks under Shah Jahan, so, too, the style favored by this ruler introduces a new classicism in form and medium. Favored is white marble or burnished stucco surfaces that emulate marble. While marble had been used sparingly by Akbar and Jahangir, it dominates Shah Jahan's palace pavilions, mosques, and the most important tomb he constructed, the Taj Mahal. The marble on secular structures, most notably palace pavilions, often is elaborately inlaid with multi-colored precious stones and at times ornately carved.  By contrast, the marble surface of religious buildings, especially mosques, remains considerably more austere, suggesting a division between secular and sacred arts not seen previously. Even enormous public structures, such as his Jami mosque of Shahjahanabad, while faced primarily with red sandstone, were profusely inlaid with white marble. ^ Asher & Talbot 2006 , p. 289 .

South Asian parties include several of the oldest in the post-colonial world, foremost among them the 129-year-old Indian National Congress that led India to independence in 1947 ^ Metcalf & Metcalf 2012 , p. 202: \"The year 1919 was a watershed in the modern history of India. [...] By its end the Montagu–Chelmsford  reforms... were enacted. [...] The year, however, also brought the repressive Rowlatt bills and the catastrophe of the Amritsar massacre. For many, if not most, Indians the reforms had become a poisoned chalice. They chose instead a novel course of political action, that of 'non-violent non-cooperation', and a new leader, Mohandas K. Gandhi, only recently returned from twenty years in South Africa. Gandhi would endure as a lasting symbol of moral leadership for the entire world community.\" ^ Stein 2010 , p. 289: \"Gandhi was the leading genius of the later and ultimately successful campaign for India's independence\" ^ Fisher 2018 , pp. 173–174: \"The partition of South Asia that produced India and West and East Pakistan resulted from years of bitter negotiations and recriminations [...] The departing British also decreed that the hundreds of princes, who ruled one-third of the subcontinent and a quarter of its population, became legally independent, their status to be settled later. Geographical location, personal and popular sentiment, and substantial pressure and incentives from the new governments led almost all princes eventually to merge their domains into either Pakistan or India. [...] Each new government asserted its exclusive sovereignty within its borders, realigning all territories, animals, plants, minerals, and all other natural and human-made resources as either Pakistani or Indian property, to be used for its national development... Simultaneously, the central civil and military services and judiciary split roughly along religious 'communal' lines, even as they divided movable government assets according to a negotiated formula: 22.7 percent for Pakistan and 77.3 percent for India.\" ^ Chatterji, Joya; Washbrook, David (2013). \"Introduction: Concepts and Questions\". In Chatterji, Joya; Washbrook, David (eds.). Routledge Handbook of the South Asian Diaspora . London and New York: Routledge. ISBN 978-0-415-48010-9 . Joya Chatterji describes how the partition of the British Indian empire into the new nation states of India and Pakistan produced new diaspora on a vast, and hitherto unprecedented, scale, but hints that the sheer magnitude of refugee movements in South Asia after 1947 must be understood in the context of pre-existing migratory flows within the partitioned regions (see also Chatterji 2013). She also demonstrates that the new national states of India and Pakistan were quickly drawn into trying to stem this migration. As they put into place laws designed to restrict the return of partition emigrants, this produced new dilemmas for both new nations in their treatment of 'overseas Indians'; and many of them lost their right to return to their places of origin in the subcontinent, and also their claims to full citizenship in host countries. ^ Talbot, Ian; Singh, Gurharpal (2009).

When the British divided and quit India in August 1947, they not only partitioned the subcontinent with the emergence of the two nations of India and Pakistan but also the provinces of Punjab and Bengal. ... Indeed for many the Indian subcontinent's division in August 1947 is seen as a unique event which defies comparative historical and conceptual analysis ^ Khan, Yasmin (2017) [2007]. The Great Partition: The Making of India and Pakistan (2nd ed.). New Haven and London: Yale University Press. p. 1. ISBN 978-0-300-23032-1 . South Asians learned that the British Indian empire would be partitioned on 3 June 1947.  They heard about it on the radio, from relations and friends, by reading newspapers and, later, through government pamphlets.  Among a population of almost four hundred million, where the vast majority live in the countryside, ploughing the land as landless peasants or sharecroppers, it is hardly surprising that many thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands, did not hear the news for many weeks afterwards. For some, the butchery and forced relocation of the summer months of 1947 may have been the first that they knew about the creation of the two new states rising from the fragmentary and terminally weakened British empire in India ^ Copland 2001 , pp. 71–78.

The ensuing cycle of escalation culminated in the 1962 Sino-Indian border war in which Mao Zedong's troops overran almost the entire state of Arunachal Pradesh in the eastern sector before unilaterally withdrawing, as if to underline the insult; most of the war's several thousand casualties were Indian. The PLA's decisive victories in the 1962 war not only humiliated the Indian Army, they also entrenched a status quo in Ladakh that was highly unfavourable for India, in which China controls almost all of the disputed territory. A nationalistic press and commentariat have kept 1962 vivid in India's popular consciousness. (c) Lintner, Bertil (2018). China's India War: Collision Course on the Roof of the World .

In October 1962 India suffered the most humiliating military debacle in its post-independence history, at the hands of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA). The outcome of this conflict had far-reaching consequences for Indian foreign and defence policies. The harsh defeat that the Chinese PLA had inflicted on the Indian Army called into question some of the most deeply held precepts of Nehru's foreign and defence policies.

The 'forward policy' adopted by India to prevent the Chinese from occupying territory claimed by them was undertaken in the mistaken belief that Beijing would be cautious in dealing with India owing to Moscow's stance on the dispute and its growing proximity to India. These misjudgments would eventually culminate in India's humiliating defeat in the war of October–November 1962. ^ Brahma Chellaney (2006). Asian Juggernaut: The Rise of China, India, and Japan .

With the ascent of the Mughal Empire in sixteenth-century India, Turkic, Persian and Afghan traditions of dress, 'architecture and cuisine' were adopted by non-Muslim indigenous elites in South Asia. In this manner, Central Asian cooking merged with older traditions within the subcontinent, to create such signature dishes as biryani (a fusion of the Persian pilau and the spice-laden dishes of Hindustan),  and the Kashmiri meat stew of Rogan Josh. It not only generated new dishes and entire cuisines, but also fostered novel modes of eating.

' Dawn-Lit Mountain Province ' ) [ 12 ] is a state in northeast India . It was formed from the North-East Frontier Agency (NEFA) region, and India declared it as a state on 20 February 1987. Itanagar is its capital and largest town. It borders the Indian states of Assam and Nagaland to the south. It shares international borders with Bhutan in the west, Myanmar in the east, and a disputed 1,129 km border with China 's Tibet Autonomous Region in the north at the McMahon Line . [ 13 ] Arunachal Pradesh is claimed in its entirety [ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ] by China as South Tibet as part of the Tibet Autonomous Region; [ 17 ] [ 18 ] China occupied some regions of Arunachal Pradesh in 1962 but later withdrew its forces. [ 19 ] : 22 [ 20 ] As of the 2011 Census of India , Arunachal Pradesh has a population of 1,383,727 and an area of 83,743 square kilometres (32,333 sq mi). With only 17 inhabitants per square kilometre, it has the least population density in India. It is an ethnically diverse state, with predominantly Monpa people in the west, Tani people in the centre, Mishmi and Tai people in the east, and Naga people in the southeast of the state. About 23 major tribes and 100 sub-tribes live in the state, [ citation needed ] including Nocte , Adi , Nyishi , Singpho , Galo , Tagin , Apatani . The Nyishi are the largest ethnic  group  in the region. The Mishmi tribe has three sub-tribes, namely Idu-Mishmi, Digaru-Mishmi and Miju-Mishmi. Etymology Arunachal Pradesh means Land of the Dawn-Lit Mountains , which is the sobriquet for the state in Sanskrit . [ 21 ] The term was coined during the formation of the state. Prior to the year 1972, it was called North-East Frontier Agency . The People's Republic of China (PRC) claims the land to be part of Tibet, and calls it South Tibet ( Chinese : 藏南 pinyin : Zàngnán ). [ 19 ] : 22 : 155 [ 22 ] In ancient Tibetan texts, eastern Arunachal Pradesh [ clarification needed ] and some parts of Tibet [ which? ] were called Lhoyü while the residents were called Lhobha people, [ 23 ] [ failed verification ] while Tawang district and West Kameng district in western Arunachal Pradesh were called Monyul. [ a ] History Ancient period Main articles: Monpa people and Prince Tsangma Very little ancient history is known about the region apart from the Northwestern corner, and the areas bordering current Assam . The Northwestern regions came under Monpa and Tibetan control. Northwestern parts of this area came under the control of the Monpa kingdom of Monyul under Tibet which flourished between 500 BCE and 600 CE. The Monpa and Sherdukpen keep historical records of the existence of local chiefdoms in the northwest as well. [ 24 ] According to Tibetan chronicles, Monyul was ruled by Gongkar Gyal, descendent of an exiled Tibetan ruler named Lhase Tsangma , the brother of Tibetan king Ralpacan who arrived in Monyul in 837 A.D or earlier. [ 25 ] A descendant of Gongkar Gyal became the ruler of Trashiyangtse region of Bhutan and  Gapde Tsan another descendant was the ruler of Khorwong valley in Thembang town (now West Kameng district , Arunachal Pradesh). [ 26 ] Thembang dzong built during the 12th century, a type of dzong commonly found in Bhutan and Tibet Later, the second son of Gongkar Gyal, Wongme Palde  who returned to Tibet owing to the poverty in Khorwong valley came back to Monyul to become its ruler. [ 26 ] The Rgyal rigs text written in 1668 or 1728 contains a record of taxes collected. Taxes were paid via coins, foodstuffs, or livestock from area around present-day Kameng district and Tawang district . [ 27 ] The Monpas ( Tibetan : མོན་པ ) ་known to the Chinese as Menba [ 28 ] were responsible for trade between Assam and Tibet and held the Koriapar Dooar at Sonitpur district of Assam . The Monpa chief were subordinate  to the ruler of Tawang who in turn were subordinate to the Government of Tibet or Ganden Phodrang in Lhasa . [ 29 ] The Tibetan government at Lhasa appointed Tibetan officials called Gellongs to supervise the local Monpa chief. The Monpa chief who looked after the Duar were called Tsorgon, a position created in the 16th century. [ 29 ] According to historical Tibetan text the state of Arunachal Pradesh known as Lhoyu came under the control of Tubo Kingdom or Tibetan Empire in the 7th century CE. [ 30 ] Arunachal Pradesh under the Tibetan Empire in 7th and 8th century CE Medieval period Main articles: Tsangyang Gyatso and Tawang Monastery Tawang Monastery built in the 17th century under the instruction of the 5th Dalai Lama , is the largest monastery in India and second-largest in the world after the Potala Palace in Lhasa , Tibet. It is one of the few monasteries of Tibetan Buddhism that have remained protected from Mao 's Cultural Revolution without any damage. [ 31 ] In the 17th century, the 5th Dalai Lama Ngawang Lobsang Gyatso (1617–1682), who achieved political supremacy over Tibet in 1642, imposed a tax called Khrey over Monyul and instructed the construction of fortresses in Monpa area called Dzong which served as centers for administration and tax collection. [ 32 ] Dirang Dzong build under instruction of the 5th Dalai Lama Ngawang Lobsang Gyatso The fortressess built were Dirang Dzong, Taklung Dzong and Gyangkhar Dzong to collect tax from the Dirang Monpa , Kalaktang Monpa and Tawang Monpa respectively. The officials who collected the taxes were called Dzongpon . [ 32 ] The tax was carried to Tawang Monastery and then to Lhasa via Tsona city (present-day China). [ 32 ] Urgelling Monastery built in 1489 A.D by Urgen Sangpo in Tawang is the birthplace of 6th Dalai Lama , Tsangyang Gyatso The 6th Dalai Lama Tsangyang Gyatso (1683–1706) was born in Tawang and died in Amdo (present-day China) on his way to Beijing after being kidnapped by the Mongol forces under Lha-bzang Khan , the last ruler of Khoshut Khanate on the approval of Kangxi Emperor of the Qing dynasty . Before his death the 6th Dalai Lama instructed the construction of notable buildings like Tromzikhang in Barkhor , Lhasa . Tromzikhang in Lhasa build under the instruction of the 6th Dalai Lama Arunachal Pradesh falls under Kham ( Tibetan : ཁམས་ ) and Ü-Tsang ( Tibetan : དབུས་གཙང་ ) cultural region of Tibet which also includes the Brahmaputra River watershed. The foothills and the plains, were under the control of the Chutia kings of Assam . Inner parts of the state remained independent and self-governed even though interactions with external parties did exist.

It was divided into three sections, which eventually came to be called the Ballipara Frontier Tract, Lakhimpur Frontier Tract and Sadiya Frontier Tract. [ 45 ] The McMahon line Main article: McMahon Line The neutrality of this section is disputed . Relevant discussion may be found on the talk page . Please do not remove this message until conditions to do so are met . ( July 2021 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) A 1936 map of Tibet by Survey of India , showing the McMahon Line The first political map of India (1947) The North-East Frontier Tracts in 1947 In 1913–1914, representatives of the de facto independent state of Tibet and Britain met in India to define the borders of 'Outer Tibet' (with respect to China). British administrator Sir Henry McMahon drew the 550 miles (890 km) McMahon Line as the border between British India and Tibet, placing Tawang and other areas within British India. The Tibetan and British representatives devised the Simla Accord including the McMahon Line, [ 46 ] but the Chinese representatives did not concur. [ 47 ] The Simla Accord denies other benefits to China while it declines to assent to the Accord. [ 48 ] The Chinese position was that Tibet was not independent from China and could not sign treaties, so the Accord was invalid, like the Anglo-Chinese (1906) and Anglo-Russian (1907) conventions. [ 49 ] British records show that the condition for the Tibetan government to accept the new border was that China must accept the Simla Convention. As Britain was not able to get an acceptance from China, Tibetans considered the McMahon line invalid. [ 47 ] In the time that China did not exercise power in Tibet, the line had no serious challenges. In 1935, a Deputy Secretary in the Foreign Department, Olaf Caroe , \"discovered\" that the McMahon Line was not drawn on official maps. The Survey of India published a map showing the McMahon Line as the official boundary in 1937. [ 50 ] In 1938, two decades after the Simla Conference, the British finally published the Simla Accord as a bilateral accord and the Survey of India published a detailed map showing the McMahon Line as a border of India. In April 1938, a small British force led by Captain G. S. Lightfoot arrived in Tawang and informed the monastery that the district was now Indian territory. [ 51 ] The Tibetan government at Lhasa protested and its authority was restored after Lightfoot's return. In 1944, Britain established administrations in the area, from Dirang Dzong in the west to Walong in the east. Administrative control extended over the area of the Tawang tract lying south of the Sela Pass when J.P. Mills set up an Assam Rifles post at Dirang Dzong and sent the Tibetan tax-collectors packing. Tibetan protests were brushed aside. However, no steps were taken to evict Tibet from the area north of the pass which contained Tawang town. [ 52 ] The Tawang district remained under Tibetan authority until 1951. Sino-Indian War Main article: Sino-Indian War Following the conclusion of British rule, India gained independence in 1947, while the People's Republic of China (PRC) was founded in 1949. The new Chinese administration maintained the position that the McMahon Line was not valid. [ 47 ] In October 1947, independent Tibet wrote a note to the Government of India asking for a \"return\" of the territories that the British had allegedly occupied from Tibet. Among these were listed Zayul and Walong and in direction of Pemakoe , Lonag, Lopa, Mon, Bhutan , Sikkim , Darjeeling . After negotiation with the  Indian government, Tibet relinquished claims on these territories. [ 53 ] [ 54 ] [ 55 ] In November 1950, the PRC was poised to take over Tibet by force , and India supported Tibet. Journalist Sudha Ramachandran argued that China claimed Tawang on behalf of Tibetans, though Tibetans did not claim Tawang as part of Tibet. [ 56 ] In February 1951, India sent Ralengnao Khathing of Manipur with a small escort and several hundred porters to Tawang and took control of the remainder of the Tawang tract from the Tibetans, removing the Tibetan administration. [ 57 ] [ b ] The Indian efforts were warmly welcomed by the native population as a respite from the oppressive feudal regime. [ citation needed ] What is now Arunachal Pradesh was established as the North-East Frontier Agency (NEFA) in 1954. Sino-Indian relations were cordial until 1960. Resurgence of the border disagreement was a factor leading to the Sino-Indian War in 1962, during which China captured most of Arunachal Pradesh, including the Tawang tract. [ 59 ] [ 60 ] [ 61 ] China soon declared victory, withdrew back to the McMahon Line , and returned Indian prisoners of war in 1963. [ 59 ] [ 60 ] [ 61 ] The war resulted in the termination of barter trade with Tibet, although since 2007 the Indian government has shown signs of wanting to resume barter trade. [ 62 ] Renaming and statehood Under the leadership of Indira Gandhi , The North-East Frontier Agency (NEFA) was renamed Arunachal Pradesh by Bibhabasu Das Shastri, Daya Krishna Goswami and O. P. Upadhya [ citation needed ] on 20 January 1972, and it became a union territory . Later on, Arunachal Pradesh became a state on 20 February 1987 during Rajiv Gandhi 's government. [ 63 ] NB: K A A Raja, as Chief Commissioner to NEFA, under Assam , whose Capital used to be Shillong , later on went to become the first Lieutenant Governor to the Union Territory of Arunachal Pradesh. [ 64 ] Recent claims The 14th Dalai Lama did not originally recognise India's sovereignty over Arunachal Pradesh. As late as 2003, he said that \"Arunachal Pradesh was actually part of Tibet\". [ 65 ] In January 2007, the Dalai Lama said that both Britain and Tibet had recognised the McMahon Line in 1914. In 2008, he said that Arunachal Pradesh was a part of India under the agreement signed by Tibetan and British representatives. [ 66 ] According to the Dalai Lama, \"In 1962 during the India-China war, the People's Liberation Army (PLA) occupied all these areas (Arunachal Pradesh) but they announced a unilateral ceasefire and withdrew, accepting the current international boundary\". [ 67 ] In recent years, China has occasionally asserted its claims on Tawang . India rebutted these claims and told the Chinese government that Tawang is an integral part of India. India reiterated this to China when the two prime ministers met in Thailand in October 2009. A report that the Chinese Army had briefly invaded Arunachal Pradesh in 2016 was denied by India's Minister of State for Home Affairs , Kiren Rijiju . [ 68 ] In April 2017, China strongly objected to a visit to Tawang by the Dalai Lama, as it had to an earlier visit by the US ambassador. [ 69 ] China had objected to the Dalai Lama's previous visits to the area. [ 70 ] In 2024, The New York Times reported that, according to satellite imagery , China had constructed villages along and inside of disputed territory within Arunachal Pradesh. [ 71 ] Chinese individuals, called \"border guardians\", received annual subsidies to relocate to newly built villages and paid to conduct border patrols. [ 71 ] Insurgency Main article: Insurgency in Arunachal Pradesh Arunachal Pradesh has faced threats from insurgent groups, notably the National Socialist Council of Nagaland (NSCN), who are believed to have base camps in the districts of Changlang and Tirap . [ 72 ] These groups seek to decrease the influence of Indian government in the region and merge part of Arunachal Pradesh into Nagaland . The Indian army is present along the Tibetan border to thwart any Chinese incursion. Under the Foreigners (Protected Areas) Order 1958 (India) , Inner Line Permits (ILPs) are required to enter Arunachal Pradesh through any of its checkgates on the border with Assam . [ citation needed ] Geography Main article: Geography of Arunachal Pradesh A kettle lake at Se La in Tawang district . Arunachal Pradesh is located between 26.28° N and 29.30° N latitude and 91.20° E and 97.30° E longitude and has an area of 83,743 km 2 (32,333 sq mi). The highest peak in the state is Kangto , at 7,060 metres (23,160 ft). Nyegi Kangsang, the main Gorichen peak, and the Eastern Gorichen peak are other tall Himalaya peaks. The state's mountain ranges, in the extreme East of India, are described as \"the place where the sun rises\" in historical Indian texts and named the Aruna Mountains, which inspired the name of the state. The villages of Dong (more accessible by car, and with a lookout favoured by tourists) and Vijaynagar (on the edge of Myanmar) receive the first sunlight in all of India. A view from Bhalukpong , a small town by the southern reaches of the Himalayas. Major rivers of Arunachal Pradesh include the Kameng , Subansiri , Siang ( Brahmaputra ), Dibang , Lohit and Noa Dihing rivers. Subsurface flows and summer snow melt contribute to the volume of water. Mountains until the Siang river are classified as the Eastern Himalayas. Those between the Siang and Noa Dihing are classified as the Mishmi Hills that may be part of the Hengduan Mountains . Mountains south of the Noa Dihing in Tirap and Longding districts are part of the Patkai Range. Climate The climate of Arunachal Pradesh varies with elevation. The low-altitude areas have a humid subtropical climate . High-altitude areas (3,500–5,500 m) have a subtropical highland climate and alpine climate. Arunachal Pradesh receives 2,000 to 5,000 millimetres (79 to 197 in) of rainfall annually, [ 73 ] 70%–80% obtained between May and October. Biodiversity Arunachal Pradesh has among the highest diversity of mammals and birds in India. There are around 750 species of birds [ 74 ] and more than 200 species of mammals [ 75 ] in the state. Ziro valley Arunachal's forests account for one-third of habitat area within the Himalayan biodiversity hot-spot. [ 76 ] In 2013, 31,273 km 2 (12,075 sq mi) of Arunachal's forests were identified as part of a vast area of continuous forests (65,730 km 2 or 25,380 sq mi, including forests in Myanmar, China and Bhutan) known as Intact forest landscapes . [ 77 ] There are three tiger reserves in the state: a reserve in Namdapha National Park , Mouling National Park and Pakke Tiger Reserve . [ 78 ] Flora In the year 2000, Arunachal Pradesh was covered with 63,093 km 2 (24,360 sq mi) of tree cover [ 79 ] (77% of its land area). It harbours over 5,000 plants. [ 80 ] At the lowest elevations, essentially at Arunachal Pradesh's border with Assam , are Brahmaputra Valley semi-evergreen forests . Much of the state, including the Himalayan foothills and the Patkai hills, are home to Eastern Himalayan broadleaf forests . Toward the northern border with Tibet, with increasing elevation, come a mixture of Eastern and Northeastern Himalayan subalpine conifer forests followed by Eastern Himalayan alpine shrub and meadows and ultimately rock and ice on the highest peaks. It supports many medicinal plants and within Ziro valley of Lower Subansiri district 158 medicinal plants are being used by its inhabitants. [ 81 ] The mountain slopes and hills are covered with alpine, temperate, and subtropical forests of dwarf rhododendron , oak , pine , maple and fir . [ 82 ] The state has Mouling and Namdapha national parks. Fauna The major animal species are tiger , leopard , snow leopard , Asian elephant , sambar deer , chital deer , barking deer , sloth bear , mithun ( Bos frontalis ), gaur , dhole , giant squirrel , marbled cat , leopard cat . [ 83 ] A new subspecies of hoolock gibbon has been described from the state which has been named as the Mishmi Hills hoolock gibbon ( H. h. mishmiensis ). [ 84 ] Three new giant flying squirrels were also described from the state during the last one and half-decade. These were, Mechuka giant flying squirrel , [ 85 ] Mishmi Hills giant flying squirrel , [ 86 ] and Mebo giant flying squirrel . [ 87 ] Administration Districts Main article: Districts of Arunachal Pradesh Arunachal Pradesh comprises three divisions, namely, Central, East and West, each headed by a divisional commissioner and twenty-five districts, each administered by a deputy commissioner . Arunachal Pradesh has a total of 28 districts, West Siang being the largest district in terms of area and Tawang being the smallest district.

The state can be roughly divided into a set of semi-distinct cultural spheres, on the basis of tribal identity, language, religion and material culture: the Tibetic -speaking Monpa area bordering Bhutan in the west, the Tani area in the centre of the state, the Mishmi area to the east of the Tani area, the Tai / Singpho / Tangsa area bordering Myanmar, and the Naga area to the south, which also borders Myanmar. In between there are transition zones, such as the Aka / Hruso / Miji / Sherdukpen area, between the Tibetan Buddhist tribes and the animist Tani hill tribes . In addition, there are isolated peoples scattered throughout the state, such as the Sulung. An Adi gaon-bura (village headman) in G.B.Simong village of the Upper Siang district, Arunachal Pradesh Within each of these cultural spheres, one finds populations of related tribes speaking related languages and sharing similar traditions. In the Tibetic area, one finds large numbers of Monpa tribespeople, with several subtribes speaking closely related but mutually incomprehensible languages, and also large numbers of Tibetan refugees. Within the Tani area, major tribes include the Nyishi . Apatani also live among the Nyishi , but are distinct. In the north one find the Tagin People. In the centre, one finds predominantly Galo people , with the major sub-groups of Karka, Lodu, Bogum, Lare and Pugo among others, extending to the Ramo and Pailibo areas (which are close in many ways to Galo). In the east, one finds the Adi with many subtribes including Padam , Pasi, Minyong and Bokar , among others. Milang , while also falling within the general Adi sphere, are in many ways quite distinct. Moving east, the Idu , Miju and Digaru make up the Mishmi cultural-linguistic area. Moving southeast, the Tai Khamti are linguistically distinct from their neighbours and culturally distinct from the majority of other Arunachalese tribes. They follow the Theravada sect of Buddhism. They also exhibit considerable convergence with the Singpho and Tangsa Naga tribes of the same area, all of which are also found in Burma. They are one of the most recent people group migrated to Arunachal region from Burma. The Nocte Naga and Wancho Naga are another two major ethnic tribes. Both the tribes exhibit very much cultural similarities. Finally, the Deori tribe is also a major community in the state, with their own distinctive identity. They are the descendants of the priestly class of Chutia people who were allowed to continue their livelihood after the defeat of the Chutias. Deoris are one of the only Arunachal tribes in the historical records – which shows they are among the first ethnic groups to inhabit the Himalayas of the districts of Dibang Valley and Lohit, before the arrival of many other tribes in the region between 1600 and 1900. Religion Main article: Religion in Arunachal Pradesh Buddhism is practised by 12% of the population. Shown here is a statue of the Buddha in Tawang , Arunachal Pradesh. Religion in Arunachal Pradesh (2011) [ 94 ] Christianity (30.3%) Hinduism (29.0%) Donyi-Polo [ 93 ] (26.2%) Buddhism (11.8%) Islam (1.95%) Others (0.78%) According to the 2011 Indian Census,  418,732 (30.26%) are Christians , 401,876 (29.04%) are Hindus , 162,815 (11.77%) Buddhists , 27,045 (1.95%) Muslims , 3,287 (0.24%) Sikhs , 771 (0.06%) Jains and 362,553 (26.20%) are adherents of various tribals belief including Donyi-Polo . [ 95 ] However, the religious landscape of Arunachal Pradesh is diverse with no single religious group representing the majority of the population, although it is one of the few Indian states where Christianity has the most followers. A relatively large percentage of Arunachal's population are nature worshippers ( indigenous religions ), and follow their own distinct traditional institutions like the Nyedar Namlo by the Nyishi , the Rangfrah by the Tangsa & Nocte , Medar Nelo by the Apatani , the Kargu Gamgi by the Galo and Donyi-Polo Dere by the Adi under the umbrella of the indigenous religion the Donyi-Polo . A small number of Arunachali people have traditionally identified as Hindus , [ 96 ] although the number may grow as animist traditions are absorbed into Hinduism. Tibetan Buddhism predominates in the districts of Tawang , West Kameng , and isolated regions adjacent to Tibet . Theravada Buddhism is practised by groups living near the Myanmar border. Around 30% of the population are Christians. [ 97 ] Buddhism arrived in Arunachal Pradesh in 8th century CE from Tibet. [ 98 ] In 1971, the percentage of Christians in the state was 0.79%. This increased to 10.3% by 1991 and by 2011 it had crossed 25%. [ 99 ] Languages See also: Arunachal languages Languages of Arunachal Pradesh in 2011 [ 100 ] Nyishi (20.7%) Adi (17.4%) Nepali (6.89%) Tagin (4.54%) Bhotia (4.52%) Wancho (4.23%) Assamese (3.89%) Bengali (3.66%) Hindi (3.45%) Chakma (3.40%) Apatani (3.21%) Mishmi (3.04%) Tangsa (2.64%) Nocte (2.19%) Bhojpuri (2.04%) Sadri (1.04%) Others (13.2%) Hindi is spoken by 62.8% (nearly 0.9 million) of the state population as a primary, secondary, or additional language, serving as the lingua franca for diverse ethnolinguistic social groups. [ 101 ] The speakers of major languages of the state according to the 2011 census are Nyishi (20.74%), Adi (17.35%, includes Adi and Gallong ), Nepali (6.89%), Tagin (4.54%), Bhotia (4.51%), Wancho (4.23%), Assamese (3.9%), Bangla (3.65%), Hindi (3.45%), Chakma (3.40%), Apatani (3.21%), Mishmi (3.04%), Tangsa (2.64%), Nocte (2.19%), Bhojpuri (2.04%) and Sadri (1.03%). The vast majority of Arunachal Pradesh speaks Tani languages of the Tibeto-Burman language family. Tani people are indigenous to central Arunachal Pradesh, including (moving from west to east) the Nyishi , the Apatani , the Tagin , the Galo , the Bokar , the Adi , the Padam , the Pasi, and the Minyong . The Tani languages are noticeably characterised by an overall relative uniformity, suggesting relatively recent origin and dispersal within their present-day area of concentration. Most of the Tani languages are mutually intelligible with at least one other Tani language, meaning that the area constitutes a dialect chain , as was once found in much of Europe; only Apatani and Milang stand out as relatively unusual in the Tani context. Tani languages are among the better-studied languages of the region. [ citation needed ] To the east of the Tani area lie three virtually undescribed and highly endangered languages of the \" Mishmi \" group of Tibeto-Burman: Idu , Digaru and Mishmi people . A number of speakers of these languages are also found in Tibet . The relationships of these languages, both among one another and to other area languages, are as yet uncertain. Further south, one finds the Singpho (Kachin) language , which is primarily spoken by large populations in Myanmar 's Kachin State , and the Nocte and Wancho languages , which show affiliations to certain Naga languages spoken to the south in modern-day Nagaland . To the west and north of the Tani area are found at least one and possibly as many as four Bodic languages , including Dakpa and Tshangla language ; within modern-day India, these languages go by the cognate but, in usage, distinct designations Monpa and Memba . Most speakers of these languages or closely related Bodic languages are found in neighbouring Bhutan and Tibet , and Monpa and Memba populations remain closely adjacent to these border regions. [ citation needed ] Between the Bodic and Tani areas lie many almost completely undescribed and unclassified languages, which, speculatively considered Tibeto-Burman, exhibit many unique structural and lexical properties that probably reflect both a long history in the region and a complex history of language contact with neighbouring populations. Among them are Sherdukpen , Bugun , Hruso , Koro , Miji , Bangru and Puroik / Sulung . The high linguistic significance these languages is belied by the extreme paucity of documentation and description of them, even in view of their highly endangered status. Puroik, in particular, is perhaps one of the most culturally and linguistically unique and significant populations in all of Asia from proto-historical and anthropological-linguistic perspectives, and yet virtually no information of any real reliability regarding their culture or language can be found in print. [ citation needed ] Finally, other than the Bodic and Tani groups, there are also certain migratory languages that are largely spoken by migratory and central government employees serving in the state in different departments and institutions in modern-day Arunachal Pradesh. [ citation needed ] They are classified as Non-Tribal as per the provisions of the Constitution of India . Outside of Tibeto-Burman, one finds in Arunachal Pradesh a single representative of the Tai family , spoken by Tai Khamti , which is closely affiliated to the Shan language of Myanmar 's Shan State . Seemingly, Khampti is a recent arrival in Arunachal Pradesh whose presence dates to 18th and/or early 19th-century migrations from northern Myanmar . [ citation needed ] In addition to English, various Indo-Aryan languages Assamese , Bengali , Nepali and especially Hindi are making strong inroads into Arunachal Pradesh. Primarily as a result of the primary education system—in which classes are generally taught by Hindi-speaking migrant teachers from Bihar and other Hindi-speaking parts of northern India, a large and growing section of the population now speaks a semi- creolised variety of Hindi as a mother tongue. Hindi acts as a lingua franca for most of the people in the state. [ 102 ] Despite, or perhaps because of, the linguistic diversity of the region, English is the only official language recognised in the state. Education Literacy has risen in official figures to 66.95% in 2011 from 54.74% in 2001. The literate population is said to number 789,943. The number of literate males is 454,532 (73.69%) and the number of literate females is 335,411 (59.57%).

[ citation needed ] Year Gross Domestic Product (Billion ₹) 1980 1.070 1985 2.690 1990 5.080 1995 11.840 2000 17.830 2005 31.880 2010 65.210 2015 155.880 Arunachal Pradesh's gross state domestic product was estimated at US$706 million at current prices in 2004 and US$1.75 billion at current prices in 2012. Agriculture primarily drives the economy. Jhum, the local term used for shifting cultivation is being widely practised among the tribal groups, though owing to the gradual growth of other sources of income in the recent years, it is not being practised as prominently as it was earlier. Arunachal Pradesh has close to 61,000 km 2 of forests, and forest products are the next most significant sector of the economy. Among the crops grown here are rice, maize, millet, wheat, pulses, sugarcane, ginger, and oilseeds. Arunachal is also ideal for horticulture and fruit orchards. Its major industries are rice mills, fruit preservation and processing units, and handloom handicrafts. Sawmills and plywood trades are prohibited under law. [ 104 ] There are many saw mills in the state. [ 105 ] A significant portion of India's unexplored hydroelectric capacity is attributed to Arunachal Pradesh. In 2008, the Arunachal Pradesh government entered into several memoranda of understanding with multiple companies, outlining around 42 hydroelectric projects intended to generate over 27,000 MW of electricity. [ 106 ] Construction of the Upper Siang Hydroelectric Project , which is expected to generate between 10,000 and 12,000 MW, began in April 2009. [ 107 ] Transport Air Itanagar Airport , a Greenfield project serving Itanagar was constructed at Holongi at a cost of ₹ 6.5 billion. [ 108 ] In 2022, IndiGo began direct flights to Itanagar from Mumbai and Kolkata . [ 109 ] [ non-primary source needed ] Alliance Air operates flights to the state flying from Kolkata via Guwahati to Pasighat Airport . This route commenced in May 2018 under the Government's Regional Connectivity Scheme UDAN following the completion of a passenger terminal at Pasighat Airport in 2017. [ 110 ] State-owned Daporijo Airport , Ziro Airport , Along Airport , and Tezu Airport are small and not in operation, but the government has proposed to develop them. [ 111 ] Before the state was connected by roads, these airstrips were used to distribute food. Roads The road from Tinsukia to Parshuram Kund Hunli Signboard The main highway of Arunachal Pradesh is the Trans-Arunachal Highway , National Highway 13 (1,293 km (803 mi); formerly NH-229 and NH-52). It originates in Tawang and spans most of the width of Arunachal Pradesh, then crosses south into Assam and ends at Wakro . The project was announced by then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in 2008 for completion by 2015–16, but only became operational in 2018. NH-15 through Assam follows the southern border of Arunachal Pradesh. Access to central Arunachal Pradesh has been facilitated by the Bogibeel Bridge , an earthquake-resistant rail and road bridge over the Brahmaputra River in Assam, opened for public use on 25 December 2018 by Prime Minister Narendra Modi . A spur highway numbered NH-415 services Itanagar. State-owned Arunachal Pradesh State Transport Services (APSTS) runs daily bus service from Itanagar to most district headquarters including Tezpur , Guwahati in Assam, Shillong in Meghalaya, and Dimapur in Nagaland. [ 112 ] [ 113 ] [ 114 ] [ 115 ] As of 2007 [update] , every village is connected by road, thanks to funding provided by the central government. Every small town has its own bus station with daily bus service. Connections to Assam have increased commerce. In 2014, two additional east–west highways were proposed: an Industrial Corridor Highway in the lower foothills, and a Frontier Highway along the McMahon Line . [ 116 ] [ 117 ] [ 118 ] [ 119 ] The proposed alignment of the Frontier Highway has been published. [ 120 ] Railway Arunachal Pradesh got its first railway line in late 2013 with the opening of the new link line from Harmuti on the main Rangpara North–Murkongselak railway line to Naharlagun in Arunachal Pradesh. The construction of the 33-kilometre 5 ft 6 in ( 1,676 mm ) broad-gauge railway line was completed in 2012, and the link became operational after the gauge conversion of the main line from Assam. The state capital Itanagar was added to the Indian railway map on 12 April 2014 via the newly built 20-kilometre Harmuti-Naharlagun railway line, when a train from Dekargaon in Assam reached Naharlagun railway station , 10 kilometres from the centre of Itanagar, a total distance of 181 kilometres. [ 121 ] [ 122 ] On 20 February 2015, the first through train was run from New Delhi to Naharlagun, flagged off from the capital by the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi . India plans to eventually extend the railway to Tawang , near the border with China. [ 123 ] Education Main article: Education in Arunachal Pradesh See also: List of institutions of higher education in Arunachal Pradesh NERIST academic block NIT Arunachal Pradesh temporary campus in Yupia The state government is expanding the relatively underdeveloped education system with the assistance of NGOs like Vivekananda Kendra , leading to a sharp improvement in the state's literacy rate. The main universities are the Rajiv Gandhi University (formerly known as Arunachal University), under which come 36 institutions offering regular undergraduate courses as well as teacher education and health sciences and nursing degrees, both under governmental and private managements, Indira Gandhi Technological and Medical Sciences University and Himalayan University [ 124 ] as well. The first college, Jawaharlal Nehru College, Pasighat, was established in 1964. The First Technical University is Established in 2014 namely North East Frontier Technical University (NEFTU) . In Aalo, West Siang District by The Automobile Society India, New Delhi. There is also a deemed university , the North Eastern Regional Institute of Science and Technology as well as the National Institute of Technology, Arunachal Pradesh , established on 18 August 2010, is located in Yupia (headquarter of Itanagar). [ 125 ] NERIST plays an important role in technical and management higher education. The directorate of technical education conducts examinations yearly so that students who qualify can continue on to higher studies in other states. St Claret College Ziro Of the above institutions, only the following institutions are accredited by NAAC ( National Assessment and Accreditation Council ), in the order of their grade: Jawaharlal Nehru College , Pasighat (Grade A), St Claret College, Ziro (Grade A), Indira Gandhi Govt. College , Tezu (Grade B++), Rajiv Gandhi University (Grade B), National Institute of Technology, Arunachal Pradesh (Grade B), Dera Natung Government College, Itanagar (Grade B), Govt. College, Bomdila (Grade B), Donyi Polo Govt. College , Kamki (Grade B), and Rang Frah Govt. College , Changeling (Grade C). Wangcha Rajkumar Government College, Deomali [ 126 ] is the only college in the southeastern part of Arunachal Pradesh. It caters to the students from Tirap , Changlang and Longding districts. There are also trust institutes, like Pali Vidyapith, run by Buddhists. They teach Pali and Khamti scripts in addition to typical education subjects. Khamti is the only tribe in Arunachal Pradesh that has its own script. Libraries of scriptures are in a number of places in Lohit district , the largest one being in Chowkham . The state has two polytechnic institutes: Rajiv Gandhi Government Polytechnic in Itanagar established in 2002 and Tomi Polytechnic College in Basar established in 2006. There are two law colleges, namely, the private-owned Arunachal Law Academy at Itanagar and the government-owned Jarbom Gamlin Government Law College at Jote, Itanagar. The College of Horticulture and Forestry is affiliated to the Central Agricultural University , Imphal . Politics See also: Politics of Arunachal Pradesh Arunachal Pradesh suffered political crisis between April 2016 and December 2016. The Indian National Congress Chief Minister Nabam Tuki replaced Jarbom Gamlin as the Chief Minister of Arunachal Pradesh on 1 November 2011 and continued until January 2016. After a political crisis in 2016, President's rule was imposed ending his tenure as the chief minister. In February 2016, Kalikho Pul became the Chief Minister when 14 disqualified MLAs were reinstated by the Supreme Court . On 13 July 2016, the Supreme Court quashed the Arunachal Pradesh Governor J.P. Rajkhowa 's order to advance the Assembly session from 14 January 2016 to 16 December 2015, which resulted in President's rule in Arunachal Pradesh. As a result, Nabam Tuki was reinstated as the Chief Minister of Arunachal Pradesh on 13 July 2016. But hours before floor test, he resigned as the chief minister on 16 July 2016. He was succeeded by Pema Khandu as the INC Chief Minister who later joined PPA in September 2016 along with majority of MLAs. Pema Khandu further joined BJP in December 2016 along with majority of MLAs. Arunachal Pradesh becomes second northeast Indian state to achieve ODF status. [ 127 ] During 2017, 2021, and 2023, China compiled a list of name alterations for multiple locations in Arunachal Pradesh, in both Chinese and Tibetan languages. China asserts these areas as belonging to \"Southern Tibet\" and being integral parts of China. The proposed changes encompassed 11 alterations, covering geographical landmarks like mountain summits and rivers, as well as residential zones. [ 128 ] The Indian government has continued to reject Chinese claims of geographical ownership of parts of Arunachal Pradesh. National military forces on both sides have increased over the Indian-Chinese border. [ 14 ] On 28 August 2023, China further provoked India when the PRC's Ministry of Natural Resources released its new 'standard map' in which Arunachal Pradesh was depicted as a part of PRC. Other internationally disputed lands and waters were also depicted as PRC territory on their new map.

[ 130 ] Namsai Organic Spices and Agricultural Producer Company Limited from Lohit, proposed the GI registration of Arunachal Pradesh Khaw Tai (Khamti Rice). After filing the application in December 2021, the rice was granted the GI tag in 2023 by the Geographical Indication Registry in Chennai , making the name \"Arunachal Pradesh Khaw Tai (Khamti Rice)\" exclusive to the rice grown in the region. It thus became the first rice variety from Arunachal Pradesh and the 3rd type of goods from Arunachal Pradesh to earn the GI tag. The GI tag protects the rice from illegal selling and marketing, and gives it legal protection and a unique identity.

The territorial dispute between China and India concerns three sectors. The eastern sector includes 90,000 square kilometers south of the McMahon Line and north of what China claims as Tibet's customary boundary, effectively the present-day Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh, previously known as the North Eastern Frontier Agency. India claims that the frontier here was delimited by the McMahon Line drawn at the 1913–14 Simla Conference. China does not recognize the McMahon Line itself or any of the documents from this conference, which it never ratified. In addition, as the line itself was drawn directly on a map, it lacks a precise delimitation. Historically, Tibet had administered the area around Tawang in the far western portion of this sector, where the sixth Dalai Lama was born, and claimed additional areas on the southern slope. After independence in 1947, India moved to assert its authority, slowly administering this region in the early 1950s and in some cases replacing local Tibetan officials. ^ Sarmah, Minakshi (2021). \"Is China's Territorial Claim On Arunachal Pradesh Justifiable?\".
